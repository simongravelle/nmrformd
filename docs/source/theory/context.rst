The measurement of NMR relaxation quantities allow for detailed studies of molecular motions
on time scales ranging from microseconds to minutes in systems as diverse as gases,
liquids, gels, proteins, polymers, adsorbed liquids, or solids.

In simulations

NMR relaxation have been used to characterize Lennard-Jones fluid 
MD simulations :cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005`.

Monte carlo simulations have also been used :cite:`friesMonteCarloCalculation1983`,
although in that case some care must be taken to extract time dependant quantities
such as autocorrelation functions :cite:`huitemaCanMonteCarlo1999`.
