  abstract = {We have investigated the structure of tert-butanol−toluene liquid mixtures when confined in the cylindrical channels of MCM-41 mesoporous silicate, and we can conclude on the existence of a microphase-separated tubular structure of these binary liquids although fully miscible in bulk conditions. Neutron diffraction experiments with selective isotopic compositions have been performed to vary systematically the scattering length density and thus to highlight different mixture components. The observed apparently anomalous variation of the intensity of the Bragg peaks of the MCM-41 after filling demonstrates without further analysis that the liquid mixture must be inhomogeneous at the nanoscale. Our experimental observations can be rationalized when comparing with the predictions of simple core−shell models. Within this core− shell model, we deduce that tert-butanol segregates as a pore surface layer of about one atomic size surrounding a toluene-rich core of two to three atomic layers.},

  abstract = {We carry out molecular dynamics of peeling of a graphene nanosheet from a flat substrate, for the case in which the system is completely immersed in water. Entrance effects are shown to dominate the dynamics of the peeling front.           ,              Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water. Peeling is induced by lifting one of the nanosheet edges with an assigned pulling velocity normal to the flat substrate. Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance. Surprisingly, the shape of the sheet was found to be approximately independent of the pulling velocity even for the largest velocities considered.},

Their distinctive properties linked to their (sub)nanometer size and hydrophobicity allow for water intrusion only under high hydrostatic pressure. Here we focus on the popular ZIF-8 material investigating the intrusion mechanism in its nanoscale cages, which is the key to its rational exploitation in target applications. In this work, we used a joint experimental/theoretical approach combining in operando synchrotron experiments during highpressure intrusion experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and stochastic models to reveal that water intrusion into ZIF-8 occurs by a cascade filling of connected cages rather than a condensation process as previously assumed. The reported results allowed us to establish structure/function relations in this prototypical microporous material, representing an important step to devise design rules to synthesize porous media.},

  abstract = {This study deals with the enhancement of CO2 uptake by ligand functionalization of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials. The ligand dipole moment could be considered as one of the main criteria for CO2 adsorption enhancement. To verify this hypothesis, an experimental–computational study was performed on an isoreticular ZIF series with sodalite (SOD) topology using published structures (ZIF-8, ZIF-90, and ZIF-Cl) as well as hypothetical structures (ZIF-COOH and ZIF-NO2) designated using DFT calculations. An analysis of structural and adsorptive properties was proposed for these materials used to separate CO2 from CH4, CO, or N2 gas. The accuracy of the calculated results was validated by comparison with our own experimental results. An exponential relationship between the ligand dipole moments and the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 was highlighted. Modifying the nature of the linker (dipole moment) allows a 5- to 7-fold improvement in CO2 selectivity for CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CO mixtures.},

  abstract = {The effect of confinement between mica and graphene on the structure and dynamics of alcohol−water mixtures has been studied in situ and in real time at the molecular level by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at room temperature. AFM images reveal that the adsorbed molecules are segregated into faceted alcohol-rich islands on top of an ice layer on mica, surrounded by a pre-existing multilayer water-rich film. These faceted islands are in direct contact with the graphene surface, revealing a preferred adsorption site. Moreover, alcohol adsorption at low relative humidity (RH) reveals a strong preference of the alcohol molecules for the ordered ice interface. The growth dynamics of the alcohol islands is governed by supersaturation, temperature, the free energy of attachment of molecules to the island edge and two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. The measured diffusion coefficients display a size dependence on the molecular size of the alcohols, and are about 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk diffusion coefficients, demonstrating the effect of confinement on the behavior of the alcohols. These experimental results provide new insights into the behavior of multicomponent fluids in confined geometries, which is of paramount importance in nanofluidics and biology.},

The 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates R1(ω) probed in the FC measurements for different isotope-labelled compounds are computed from the MD trajectories for broad frequency and temperature ranges. We find high correspondence between experiment and simulation. Concerning the rotational motion, we observe that the aliphatic and hydroxyl groups show similar correlation times but different stretching parameters, while the overall reorientation associated with the structural relaxation remains largely isotropic. Additional analysis of the simulation results reveals that transitions between different molecular configurations are slow on the time scale of the structural relaxation at least at sufficiently high temperatures, indicating that glycerol rotates at a rigid entity, but the reorientation is slower for elongated than for compact conformers. The translational contribution to R1(ω) is well described by the force-free hard sphere model. At sufficiently low frequencies, universal square-root laws provide access to the molecular diffusion coefficients. In both experiment and simulation, the time scales of the rotational and translational motions show an unusually large separation, which is at variance with the Stokes–Einstein–Debye relation. To further explore this effect, we investigate the structure and dynamics on various length scales in the simulations. We observe that a prepeak in the static structure factor S(q), which is related to a local segregation of aliphatic and hydroxyl groups, is accompanied by a peak in the correlation times τ(q) from coherent scattering functions.},

  abstract = {After 70 years, modern pressure-driven polymer membrane processes with liquids are mature and accepted in many industries due to their good performance, ease of scale-up, low energy consumption, modular compact construction, and low operating costs compared with thermal systems. Successful isothermal operation of synthetic membranes with liquids requires consideration of three critical aspects or “legs” in order of relevance: selectivity, capacity (i.e. permeation flow rate per unit area) and transport of mass and momentum comprising concentration polarization (CP) and fouling (F). Major challenges remain with respect to increasing selectivity and controlling mass transport in, to and away from membranes. Thus, prediction and control of membrane morphology and a deep understanding of the mechanism of dissolved and suspended solute transport near and in the membrane (i.e. diffusional and convective mass transport) is essential. Here, we focus on materials development to address the relatively poor selectivity of liquid membrane filtration with polymers and discuss the critical aspects of transport limitations. Machine learning could help optimize membrane structure design and transport conditions for improved membrane filtration performance.},

The effect of several operating variables (temperature, feed and permeate pressures, feed composition, use of sweep gas, presence of water in the feed, membrane module configuration) was investigated. The separation between CO2 and N2 takes place because of the preferential adsorption of CO2, which hinders the permeation of N2 through the zeolite pore network. The best results in this work were obtained with a Na-ZSM5 membrane, and using a large pressure gradient. In this case, a permeation flux as large as 9.2 kg/(m2 · h) [permeance of 2.6 × 10−6 mol/(m2 · s · Pa)] with a CO2/N2 separation factor of 13.7 was obtained. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 127–135, 2004},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a molecular simulation study of the thermodynamics, structure and dynamics of water confined at ambient temperature in hydroxylated silica nanopores of a width H = 10 and 20 A˚ . The adsorption isotherms for water in these nanopores resemble those observed for experimental samples; the adsorbed amount increases continuously in the multilayer adsorption regime until a jump occurs due to capillary condensation of the fluid within the pore. Strong layering of water in the vicinity of the silica surfaces is observed as marked density oscillations are observed up to 8 A˚ from the surface in the density profiles for confined water. Our results indicate that water molecules within the first adsorbed layer tend to adopt a H-down orientation with respect to the silica substrate. For all pore sizes and adsorbed amounts, the self-diffusivity of confined water is lower than the bulk, due to the hydrophilic interaction between the water molecules and the hydroxylated silica surface. Our results also suggest that the self-diffusivity of confined water is sensitive to the adsorbed amount.},

At high water contents the spectrum is a superposition of a narrow central component and a quadrupole doublet. The quadrupole splitting and the relaxation rates of both components, monitored as a function of water content and temperature, are discussed in terms of models for the water-protein interaction. The anisotropy of the water molecule motion is clearly demonstrated by the deuterium quadrupole splitting observed in the protein single crystal, but such splittings were not found in protein powders and frozen protein solutions. We therefore suggest that the most useful view of such data is to consider the water-protein interactions at the surface to be mixed rapidly and that a distribution of interactions be invoked rather than an oversimplified view often taken of a two or n-site mixing where n is small.},

Moreover, by relating the local chemical potential μ(r) and density ρ(r), the present model accounts for adsorption effects and possible changes in the confined fluid state upon transport. This model constitutes a bottom-up framework of adsorption and transport in multiscale materials as it (1) describes the adsorption-transport interplay, (2) accounts for the hydrodynamics breakdown at the nm scale, and (3) is multiscale.},

The unique diffusion mechanisms in such solids stem from restricted pore relocation and ill-defined surface boundaries. While diffusion fundamentals in simple geometries are well-established, fluids in complex materials challenge existing frameworks. Here, we invoke the intermittent surface/pore diffusion formalism to map molecular dynamics onto random walk in disordered media. Our hierarchical strategy allows bridging microscopic/mesoscopic dynamics with parameters obtained from simple laws. The residence and relocation times – tA, tB – are shown to derive from pore size d and temperature-rescaled surface interaction ε/kBT. tA obeys a transition state theory with a barrier\,\textasciitilde ε/kBT and a prefactor\,\textasciitilde 10−12 s corrected for pore diameter d. tB scales with d which is rationalized through a cutoff in the relocation first passage distribution. This approach provides a formalism to predict any fluid diffusion in complex media using parameters available to simple experiments.},

  abstract = {Small differences in physical and chemical properties of H2O and D2O, such as melting and boiling points or pKa, can be traced back to a slightly stronger hydrogen bonding in heavy versus normal water. In particular, deuteration reduces zeropoint vibrational energies as a demonstration of nuclear quantum effects. In principle, computationally demanding quantum molecular dynamics is required to model such effects. However, as already demonstrated by Feynmann and Hibbs, zero-point vibrations can be effectively accounted for by modifying the interaction potential within classical dynamics. In the spirit of the Feymann−Hibbs approach, we develop here two water models for classical molecular dynamics by fitting experimental differences between H2O and D2O. We show that a three-site SPCE-based model accurately reproduces differences between properties of the two water isotopes, with a four-site TIP4P-2005/based model in addition capturing also the absolute values of key properties of heavy water. The present models are computationally simple enough to allow for extensive simulations of biomolecules in heavy water relevant, for example, for experimental techniques such as NMR or neutron scattering.},

The associated coupling mechanism responsible for the observed sorption-induced swelling and associated hysteresis needs to be unraveled. Here we report a microscopic scenario for the molecular mechanism responsible for hysteresis in sorption-induced swelling in natural polymers such as cellulose using atom-scale simulation; moisture content and swelling exhibit hysteresis upon ad- and desorption but not swelling versus moisture content. Different hydrogen bond networks are examined; cellulose swells to form water–cellulose bonds upon adsorption but these bonds do not break upon desorption at the same chemical potential. These findings, which are supported by mechanical testing and cellulose textural assessment upon sorption, shed light on experimental observations for wood and other related materials.},

We find the stabilizing contribution to the free energy of association (contact pair formation) to be the favorable entropic part, the enthalpic contribution being highly unfavorable. The desolvation barrier is dominated by the unfavorable enthalpic contribution in spite of a fairly large favorable entropic compensation. The enthalpic contributions, incorporating the Lennard-Jones solute-solvent terms, largely determine the stability of the solvent separated configuration. We decompose the enthalpy into a direct solute-solute term, the solute-solvent interactions and the remainder that contains pressure-volume work as well as contributions due to solvent reorganization. The enthalpic contribution due to changes in water-water interactions arising from solvent reorganization around the solute molecules is shown to have major contribution in the solvent induced enthalpy change.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation of quadrupolar nuclei is governed by the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations at their position. In classical molecular dynamics (MD), the electron cloud contribution to the EFG can be included via the Sternheimer approximation, in which the full EFG at the nucleus that can be computed using quantum density functional theory (DFT) is considered to be proportional to that arising from the external, classical charge distribution. In this work, we systematically assess the quality of the Sternheimer approximation as well as the impact of the classical force field (FF) on the NMR relaxation rates of aqueous quadrupolar ions at infinite dilution. In particular, we compare the rates obtained using an ab initio parametrized polarizable FF, a recently developed empirical FF with scaled ionic charges and a simple empirical nonpolarizable FF with formal ionic charges. Surprisingly, all three FFs considered yield good values for the rates of smaller and less polarizable solutes (Li+, Na+, K+, Cl−), provided that a model-specific Sternheimer parametrization is employed. Yet, the polarizable and scaled charge FFs yield better estimates for divalent and more polarizable species (Mg2+, Ca2+, Cs+). We find that a linear relationship between the quantum and classical EFGs holds well in all of the cases considered; however, such an approximation often leads to quite large errors in the resulting EFG variance, which is directly proportional to the computed rate. We attempted to reduce the errors by including first order nonlinear corrections to the EFG, yet no clear improvement for the resulting variance has been found. The latter result indicates that more refined methods for determining the EFG at the ion position, in particular those that take into account the instantaneous atomic environment around an ion, might be necessary to systematically improve the NMR relaxation rate estimates in classical MD.},

Yet, obtaining links to molecular motion is challenging for many ions that relax through the quadrupolar mechanism, which is mediated by electric field gradient fluctuations and lacks a detailed microscopic description. For sodium ions in aqueous electrolytes, we combine ab initio calculations to account for electron cloud effects with classical molecular dynamics to sample long-time fluctuations, and obtain relaxation rates in good agreement with experiments over broad concentration and temperature ranges. We demonstrate that quadrupolar nuclear relaxation is sensitive to subpicosecond dynamics not captured by previous models based on water reorientation or cluster rotation. While ions affect the overall water retardation, experimental trends are mainly explained by dynamics in the first two solvation shells of sodium, which contain mostly water. This work thus paves the way to the quantitative understanding of quadrupolar relaxation in electrolyte and bioelectrolyte systems.},

  abstract = {Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a promising material for the energy-efficient recovery of bioalcohols from aqueous mixtures. Its adsorption isotherms have inflection points and breakthrough curves obtained in dynamic column separation experiments exhibit stepped profiles. With the aim to optimize this adsorptive alcohol recovery process using ZIF-8, the correlation between the shape of the adsorption isotherms and the breakthrough curves was further explored in this work by means of liquid phase batch measurements and breakthrough experiments, with diluted ethanol/water mixtures. The shape of the concentration profiles, in adsorption mode as well in desorption mode, have been carefully analyzed making use of simple theoretical tools, including an axial dispersion model and a wave theory based approach. It was shown that, as a direct expression of the adsorption isotherm and the feed concentration, the concentration profiles were composed of different ‘‘shock waves” and ‘‘dispersive waves” propagating at different velocities along the column length. The description of the breakthrough and desorption curves in terms of propagation velocities enabled to gain insights into the fundamental role of the adsorption isotherm into the characteristics and the formation of the concentration profiles. The concept of ‘‘fractional used bed capacity” (FUBC) was introduced to illustrate the effect of the adsorption isotherm shape on the dynamic capacity at breakthrough point. According to the shape of the adsorption isotherm, efficient desorption could be achieved with the ZIF-8 material. This work provides, with limited computational effort, new perspectives for the further development and optimization of adsorptive separation processes with MOF materials, such as the recovery of bio-alcohols from aqueous mixtures with the ZIF-8 adsorbent.},

A silica force field is introduced that resolves numerous shortcomings of prior silica force fields over the last 30 years and reduces uncertainties in computed interfacial properties relative to experiment from several 100\% to less than 5\%. In addition, a silica surface model database is introduced for the full range of variable surface chemistry and pH (Q2, Q3, Q4 environments with adjustable degree of ionization) that have shown to determine selective molecular recognition. The force field enables accurate computational predictions of aqueous interfacial properties of all types of silica, which is substantiated by extensive comparisons to experimental measurements. The parameters are integrated into multiple force fields for broad applicability to biomolecules, polymers, and inorganic materials (AMBER, CHARMM, COMPASS, CVFF, PCFF, INTERFACE force fields). We also explain mechanistic details of molecular adsorption of water vapor, as well as significant variations in the amount and dissociation depth of superficial cations at silica−water interfaces that correlate with ζpotential measurements and create a wide range of aqueous environments for adsorption and self-assembly of complex molecules. The systematic analysis of binding conformations and adsorption free energies of distinct peptides to silica surfaces will be reported separately in a companion paper. The models aid to understand and design silica nanomaterials in 3D atomic resolution and are extendable to chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, the research on fluids in nanoconfined geometries has received considerable attention as a consequence of their wide applications in different fields. Several nanoconfined systems such as water and ionic liquids, together with an equally impressive array of nanoconfining media such as carbon nanotube, graphene and graphene oxide have received increasingly growing interest in the past years. Water is the first system that has been reviewed in this article, due to its important role in transport phenomena in environmental sciences. Water is often considered as a highly nanoconfined system, due to its reduction to a few layers of water molecules between the extended surface of large macromolecules. The second system discussed here is ionic liquids, which have been widely studied in the modern green chemistry movement. Considering the great importance of ionic liquids in industry, and also their oil/water counterpart, nanoconfined ionic liquid system has become an important area of research with many fascinating applications. Furthermore, the method of molecular dynamics simulation is one of the major tools in the theoretical study of water and ionic liquids in nanoconfinement, which increasingly has been joined with experimental procedures. In this way, the choice of water and ionic liquids in nanoconfinement is justified by applying molecular dynamics simulation approaches in this review article.},

  abstract = {The static dielectric constant at room temperature and the temperature of maximum density are used as target properties to develop, by molecular dynamics simulations, the TIP4P/ε force field of water. The TIP4P parameters are used as a starting point. The key step, to determine simultaneously both properties, is to perform simulations at 240 K where a molecular dipole moment of minimum density is found. The minimum is shifted to larger values of μ as the distance between the oxygen atom and site M, lOM, decreases. First, the parameters that define the dipole moment are adjusted to reproduce the experimental dielectric constant and then the Lennard-Jones parameters are varied to match the temperature of maximum density. The minimum on density at 240 K allows understanding why reported TIP4P models fail to reproduce the temperature of maximum density, the dielectric constant, or both properties. The new model reproduces some of the thermodynamic and transport anomalies of water. Additionally, the dielectric constant, thermodynamics, and dynamical and structural properties at different temperatures and pressures are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The computational cost of the new model is the same as that of the TIP4P.},

Alcohol/water is one of the most common systems in liquid−liquid separation. As one of the most focused systems, recent studies have found that ethanol molecules were preferentially adsorbed on the inner surface of the pore wall and formed an adsorbed ethanol layer under 2D nanoconfinement. To evaluate the effect of the alcohol adsorption layer on the mobility of water molecules, molecular simulations were performed to investigate four types of alcohol/water binary mixtures confined under a 20 Å graphene slit. Residence times of the water molecules covering the alcohol layer were in the order of methanol/water {$<$} ethanol/water {$<$} 1-propanol/water {$<$} 1-butanol/water. Detailed microstructural analysis of the hydrogen bonding (H-bond) network elucidated the underlying mechanism on the molecular scale in which a small average number of H-bonds between the preferentially adsorbed alcohol molecules and the surrounding water molecules could induce a small degree of damage to the H-bond network of the water molecules covering the alcohol layer, resulting in the long residence time of the water molecules.},

  abstract = {Series of molecular dynamics simulations for ethanol−water mixtures with 20−80 mol \% ethanol content, pure ethanol, and water were performed. In each mixture, for ethanol the OPLS force field was used, combined with three different water force fields, the SPC/E, the TIP4P-2005, and the SWM4-DP. Water potential models were distinguished on the basis of deviations between calculated and measured total scattering X-ray structure factors aided by ethanol−water pair binding energy comparison. No single water force field could provide the best agreement with experimental data at all concentrations: at the ethanol content of 80\% the SWM-DP, for 60 mol \% the SWM4-DP and the TIP4P-2005, whereas for the 40 and 20 mol \% mixtures TIP4P-2005 water force field provided the closest match. Coordination numbers and hydrogen bonds/molecule values were calculated, revealing that the oxygen−oxygen first coordination numbers strongly overestimate the average number of hydrogen bonds/molecule. The center-of-molecule distributions indicate that the ethanol−ethanol first coordination sphere expands with increasing water concentration while the size of the first water−water coordination sphere does not change. Various two and three-dimensional distributions were calculated that reveal the differences between simulations with different water force fields. Detailed conformational analyses of the hydrogen−bonded pairs were performed; drawings of the characteristic molecular arrangements are provided.},

To this day, many properties of water and its mixtures, in particular, under confinement, are not understood. In recent years, molecular dynamics simulations developed into a powerful tool to improve our knowledge in this field. Here, our simulation results for water and aqueous mixtures in the bulk and in various confinements are reviewed and some new simulation data are added to improve our knowledge about the role of interfaces. Moreover, findings for water are compared with results for silica, exploiting that both systems form tetrahedral networks.},

  abstract = {Since the structural transformations observed in water-ethanol binary mixtures are apparently driven by relatively weak intermolecular forces (like hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding) that often cooperate to form self-assembled structures, one expects the aggregation properties to show strong temperature dependence. We study the effect of temperature on the formation of transient ethanol clusters as well as on the dynamic density heterogeneity induced in the system due to such clustering. The dynamic heterogeneity is expected to occur on small length scales with short lifetime – both are expected to be temperature dependent. Indeed, a major finding of the work is strong temperature dependence of the extent of structural heterogeneity. Distinct signature of static and dynamic heterogeneity of ethanol molecules is also found to appear with lowering of temperature. This is attributed to the formation of transient ethanol clusters that are known to exhibit considerably small lifetime (order of a few picosecond). The transient dynamical features of dynamic heterogeneity are expected to affect those relaxation processes occurring at subpicosecond time scales. On the other hand, strong temperature dependence of micro-structure formation can be anticipated to be due to enhanced structural order stimulated in the system with lowering of temperature. Present analyses reveal a number of interesting features which were not explored beforehand in this widely studied binary mixture.},

Here, we perform simulations of particles reversibly adsorbing at the surface of a nanopore and show that the fluctuations in the number of adsorbed particles exhibit low-frequency pink noise. We furthermore propose theoretical modeling for the timedependent adsorption of particles on the nanopore surface for various geometries, which predicts a frequency spectrum in very good agreement with the simulation results. Altogether, our results highlight that the low-frequency noise takes its origin in the reversible adsorption of ions at the pore surface combined with the long-lasting excursions of the ions in the reservoirs. The scaling regime of the power spectrum extends down to a cutoff frequency which is far smaller than simple diffusion estimates. Using realistic values for the pore dimensions and the adsorption−desorption kinetics, this predicts the observation of pink noise for frequencies down to the hertz for a typical solid-state nanopore, in good agreement with experiments.},

  abstract = {NMR relaxometry is a powerful and wellestablished experimental approach for characterizing dynamic processes in soft matter systems. All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length scales that prevent to model systems such as long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of losing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by performing a systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 on a PEG−H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intramonomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories.},

  abstract = {Tillandsia landbeckii is a rootless plant thriving in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert of Chile. These plants use unique cellulose-based microscopic structures called trichomes to collect fresh water from coastal fog. The trichomes rely on a passive mechanism to maintain an asymmetrical transport of water: they allow for the fast absorption of liquid water deposited by sporadic fog events while preventing evaporation during extended drought periods. Inspired by the trichome’s design, we study fluid transport through a micrometric valve. Combining Grand Canonical Monte Carlo with Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations, we first analyze the adsorption and transport of a fluid through a single nanopore at different chemical potentials. We then scale up the atomic results using a lattice approach, and simulate the transport at the micrometric scale. Results obtained for a model Lennard-Jones fluid and TIP4P/2005 water were compared, allowing us to identify the key physical parameters for achieving a passive hydraulic valve. Our results show that the difference in transport properties of water vapor and liquid water within the cellulose layer is the basis for the ability of the Tillandsia trichome to function as a water valve. Finally, we predict a critical pore dimension above which the cellulose layer can form an efficient valve.},

  abstract = {Significance             Aquaporin channels are able to selectively conduct water across cell membranes, with remarkable efficiency. Although molecular details are crucial to the pore performance, permeability is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation at the entrances. Could the hourglass shape of aquaporins optimize such entrance effects? We show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the channel permeability. Strikingly, the optimal opening angles compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins, suggesting that their hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. This work also provides guidelines to optimize the performances of artificial nanopores, with applications in desalination, ultrafiltration, or energy conversion.           ,              The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that maximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of aquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal hydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results provide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.},

  abstract = {Under ambient atmospheric conditions, a thin film of water wets many solid surfaces, including insulators, ice, and salt. The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.},

The resulting density profiles illustrate that demixing of solvents occurs at the pore wall region, which is composed of silanol molecules in our case. Ethanol molecules are more likely to attach to the wall via hydrogen bonds than water molecules. A noticeable O−H bond orientation is observed for the ethanol molecules in this region, which can be explained by the formation of two specific hydrogen bonds between ethanol and silanol. Water, in contrast, resides mostly outside the interfacial region and is in favor of forming small hydrogen bonded strings and clusters with other water molecules. This phenomenon is corroborated by both the orientation of ethanol hydroxyl groups and the radial distribution functions of the solvent oxygen atom to the silanol hydrogen atom. Ethanol selectively attaches to the wall and forms a layer close to the wall. The hydrophobic headgroups of these ethanol molecules lead to an internal hydrophobic interface layer, which in turn yields cluster structures in the adjacent water. The self-diffusion of water in the confined ethanol−water mixture at the center of the pore is faster than that of water in the bulk ethanol−water mixture; ethanol, on the other hand, diffuses slower when it is confined.},

  abstract = {Aqueous binary mixtures have received immense attention in recent years because of their extensive application in several biological and industrial processes. The water−ethanol binary mixture serves as a unique system because it exhibits composition-dependent alteration of dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our present work demonstrates how different compositions of water−ethanol binary mixtures affect the pair hydrophobicity of different hydrophobes. Pair hydrophobicity is measured by the depth of the first minimum (contact minima) of potential of mean force (PMF) profile between two hydrophobes. The pair hydrophobicity is found to be increased with addition of ethanol to water up to a mole fraction of xEtOH = 0.10 and decreased with further addition of ethanol. This observation is shown to be true for three (methane−methane, isobutane−isobutane, and toluene−toluene) different pairs of hydrophobes. Decomposition of PMF into enthalpic and entropic contribution indicates a switch from entropic to enthalpic stabilization of the contact minimum upon addition of ethanol to water. The gain in mixing enthalpy of the binary solvent system upon association of two hydrophobes is found to be the determining factor for the stabilization of contact minimum. Several static/ dynamics quantities (average composition fluctuations, diffusion coefficients, fluctuations in total dipole moment, propensity of ethyl−ethyl association, etc) of the ethanol−water binary mixture also show irregularities around xEtOH = 0.10−0.15. We have also discovered that the hydrogen bonding pattern of ethanol rather than water reveals a change in trend near the similar composition range. As the anomalous behavior of the physical/dynamical properties along with the pair hydrophobicity in an aqueous binary mixture of amphiphilic solutes is a common phenomenon, our results may provide a general viewpoint on these aspects.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data from water nuclei (1H, 2H, and 17O) can provide much information about the state of water in heterogeneous systems. In the present work, we present a theoretical framework for the interpretation of such data and discuss the implications of the theory. Due to the local anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, it is necessary to consider two components of water motion: a fast anisotropic reorientation superposed on a more extensive slow motion. On the basis of the experimentally verified assumption that these motions occur on different time scales, we develop a ’’two-step’’ model of relaxation, showing that both motions may give important contributions to the relaxation. We derive a simple expression for the relevant correlation function, valid for isotropic systems. Anisotropic systems are also treated, making use of a new symmetry theorem for time correlation functions. The proof of this theorem is given in an Appendix. The magnitudes of the water 2H and 17O quadrupole coupling constants are estimated to 0.222 and 6.67 MHz, respectively. Results of ab\hphantom{,}initio quantum chemical calculations are presented, demonstrating the insensitivity of the water 17O field gradient to nearby ionic species. The possibilities and limitations of the NMR technique in answering the fundamental questions about water structure and dynamics in heterogeneous systems are discussed. We suggest a novel interpretation of the well-known invariance of the ratio of 1H and 2H splittings. Furthermore, we argue that the available NMR data are consistent with a short-ranged (≲2 molecular layers) perturbation of the water tumbling rate and anisotropy.},

  abstract = {Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on metal–organic framework (MOF) have great promising application in separation of gas mixtures. However, achieving a good interfacial compatibility between polymer and MOF is not straightforward. In this work, focusing on one of the most challenging olefin/paraffin separations: propylene/ propane (C3H6/C3H8), we demonstrate that modification of the MOF filler via dopamine polymerization using a double solvent approach strongly improves interfacial compatibility. The resulting membranes show an outstanding separation performance and long-term stability with propylene permeability nearly 90 Barrer and propylene/ propane selectivity close to 75. We anticipate that similar MOF modification strategies may help solve the problem of interface defects in the manufacture of MMMs and be extended to other porous fillers.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates are reported at 30 MHz for water protons adsorbed on lysozyme powders from the gas phase as a function of temperature and water content. The free induction decay amplitude accounts for all of the water protons in the sample over the range of water concentrations studies. Two types of model are considered to interpret the transverse NMR relaxation data. It is shown that a multisite fast exchange model which assumes water concentration independent protein binding sites is inconsistent with the data. A crude model that includes the possibility that water molecule motion at all sites may be influenced by subsequent addition of water does account for the observations. A chemical exchange model and a cross-relaxation model are considered as sources of the nonexponential decay observed in the longitudinal relaxation data throughout the temperature and concentration range studied. It is shown that when cross-relaxation between protein protons and water protons is included, long water molecule residence times at protein sites are not required and that the usual approaches to the analysis of water relaxation at surfaces must be altered. The data demonstrate that the rate of water molecule motion decreases with decreasing water content, even though some distribution of motional correlation times may be appropriate. The water in the immediate vicinity of the protein surface appears to be best characterized as a viscous liquid but not as a solid.},

The activation energies E1=9.4± 0.8\,kcal/mole and E2=3.6± 0.1\,kcal/mole for the two contributions to the intermolecular relaxation are in sufficiently good agreement with those for the intramolecular relaxation to indicate that the relaxation mechanism is the same in both cases.

  abstract = {Direct air capture is a key carbon dioxide removal technology to mitigate climate change and keep the global average temperature rise below 1.5–2 ◦C. This work addresses for the first time the use of ionic liquids for direct air capture connecting their material design by molecular simulation to process modelling. First, 26 different ionic liquids were designed through quantum chemical calculations and their isotherms were computed to identify those with a positive cyclic working capacity at conditions relevant for direct air capture. Then, the most promising ionic liquids were assessed via process simulations in Aspen Plus. A wide range of operating config­ urations were screened by modifying the key process variables: air velocity (1 – 3 m/s), solvent mass flow (5 – 50 t/h) and temperature (293 – 323 K), and regeneration pressure (0.1 – 1 bar) and temperature (373 – 393 K). Exergy, energy and productivity were computed to detect optimal operating conditions; moreover, a simplified economic analysis was carried out to highlight the major cost components. The direct air capture system based on [P66614][Im] exhibited the most exergy (5.44 – 16.73 MJ/kg) and energy (15.15 – 35.42 MJ/kg) efficiency for similar productivity (0.5 – 1.3 kg/(m3⋅h)) thanks to its enhanced cyclic capacity (0.6 – 0.3 mol/kg). The mini­ mum exergy required by [P66614][Im]-based DAC process is slightly better than alkali scrubbing (6.21 MJ/kg) and in line with amine (5.59 MJ/kg) scrubbing. In addition, the assessed DAC process has a theoretical potential to operate in the range of 200 \$/tCO2 under reasonable energy and plant expenses. We conclude this work providing guidelines to address future development of direct air capture technologies based on ionic liquids.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic relaxation and the electron-nucleus Overhauser effect on spin ½ nuclei in solutions containing free radicals are calculated on the assumption that the nuclei and electrons interact by means of magnetic dipole–dipole interactions and scalar spin–spin interactions. The time dependence of the dipole–dipole interactions is assumed to be due to the translational diffusion of the free radicals and the molecules containing the nuclei. Two models are employed for the scalar interactions. In the first of these, there is a scalar interaction only while a molecule is stuck to a free radical, and the time for which they are stuck is a random variable. In the second model, the hypothesis is made that the scalar interaction is a very short range interaction with magnitude               ħA               (               d/R               ) exp [–               λ               (               R–d               )], where               λ               d               ≫ 1,               A               and               λ               are constants,               R               is the distance between a nucleus and an electron, and               d               is a distance of closest approach, inside of which the interaction is zero. In the second model, the time dependence of the scalar interaction, as in the case of the dipole–dipole interactions, is due to the relative diffusion of the molecules and free radicals in the solution. For the second model, it is found that the frequency dependence of the spectral density of a scalar interaction is very similar to the frequency dependence of the spectral density of a dipole–dipole interaction, no matter how short range the scalar interaction is made by making               λd               very large. For both models of the scalar interaction it is found that the sign of the steady-state Overhauser effect may change from positive to negative as the magnetic field is increased, but that this is more likely to happen for the first model of the scalar interactions than for the second. The interpretation of experiments in terms of the results derived here is discussed, with particular attention given to experiments performed at two different magnetic fields. It is found that in some cases it may be possible to determine which model of the scalar interactions gives better agreement with experiment, and to determine values for the contributions of the scalar and the dipolar interactions, the distance of closest approach, and the relative diffusion coefficient.},

However, despite its widespread use, key questions regarding the thickness and composition of molecules at the ethanol/water/air surface remain unclear. Recent thermodynamic analyses, Bagheri and co-authors (2016) and Santos and Reis (2018), indicated that the interfacial thickness is not constant. However, the interfacial thickness from these two analyses follows opposite trends. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the thickness and composition of the interfacial layer by combining neutron reflectivity (NR) experiments with rigorous molecular simulation. The interfacial composition was determined from molecular simulations and, in conjunction with the Gibbs excess concentration, used to calculate the interfacial thickness. It was found that the thickness decreased exponentially and reached a plateau of \textasciitilde{} 8.2 Å. The results confirm the trends obtained thermodynamically from surface tension. The study also provides a new theoretical framework to describe the interfacial layer of water/alcohol mixtures.},

This study gives some new information on the microstructure, the water distribution, and the hydration kinetics without any drying or perturbing preparation. The bi-exponential transverse magnetization decay reveals the existence of two water populations in slow exchange. However, the different behaviors of these populations during saturation and desaturation experiments show evidence of a fast exchange of each population with the surface. Two modes of organization of the microstructure of this material are identified through an original model of exchange as a function of the water-to-plaster ratio (0.4 ≤ w/p ≤ 0.6 and 0.7 ≤ w/p ≤ 1). A clear gap is shown in the exchange rate value above w/p = 0.6 that could be representative of a percolation threshold. Both the method and the theory presented can be applied more widely to other porous media with reactive surface areas.},

The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

  abstract = {The parametrization and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

We measured isosteric adsorption enthalpies and entropies by inverse gas chromatography for coverages ranging from 0.1 to 20\%. The adsorption enthalpies were found to vary with surface coverage and differed considerably between the materials at low coverage. However, they approached the same adsorption enthalpy value of −12.0 ± 0.4 kcal/mol for T centered at 303−393 K and coverages above 5\%. We explained the observed behavior using molecular dynamics simulations by employing empirical force-field and density functional theory calculations on two graphene models: circumcoronene and infinite graphene. The simulations showed that various hydrogen-bonded ethanol clusters formed spontaneously from isolated ethanol molecules on graphene and provided a distribution of cluster sizes. Nonlocal density functional theory was used to calculate adsorption enthalpies for various sizes of ethanol clusters. A theoretical adsorption enthalpy of −11.6 kcal/mol at 340 K was obtained from the weighted average of the cluster size distribution, while the adsorption enthalpy of single ethanol molecule to graphene was −6.3 kcal/mol at 323 K.},

We describe the subtle differences in molecular organization that result in the observed differences in the VSF spectra for methanol and ethanol at the alcohol−silica interface. Alcohol molecules hydrogen-bonded to the silica surface induce orientational opposition in an adjacent low-population region, which implies VSF signal reduction. This low population region is essentially of zero density in the ethanol system, implying less signal cancelation. Simulated silica defect sites increase the population of this region in both systems. Interestingly, the induced orientation in this region influences subsequent molecular orientation only in the ethanol−silica system, preserving the interfacial anisotropy. These effects suggest a stronger VSF response from the ethanol−silica system versus the methanol−silica system, where more methanol molecules reside in the low-population region, and this region does not induce order in subsequent solvent layers.},

In a previous article [Kashefolgheta               et al.               ,               J. Chem. Theory. Comput               ., 2020,               16               , 7556–7580], we showed how the involved comparison between experimental and simulation results could be made more systematic by considering a full matrix of cross-solvation free energies                              . For a set of               N               molecules that are all in the liquid state under ambient conditions, such a matrix encompasses               N               ×               N               entries for                              considering each of the               N               molecules either as solute (A) or as solvent (B). In the quoted study, a cross-solvation matrix of 25 × 25 experimental                              value was introduced, considering 25 small molecules representative for alkanes, chloroalkanes, ethers, ketones, esters, alcohols, amines, and amides. This experimental data was used to compare the relative accuracies of four popular condensed-phase force fields, namely GROMOS-2016H66, OPLS-AA, AMBER-GAFF, and CHARMM-CGenFF. In the present work, the comparison is extended to five additional force fields, namely GROMOS-54A7, GROMOS-ATB, OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, and OpenFF. Considering these nine force fields, the correlation coefficients between experimental values and simulation results range from 0.76 to 0.88, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.9 to 4.8 kJ mol               −1               , and average errors (AVEEs) from −1.5 to +1.0 kJ mol               −1               . In terms of RMSEs, GROMOS-2016H66 and OPLS-AA present the best accuracy (2.9 kJ mol               −1               ), followed by OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, AMBER-GAFF, and OpenFF (3.3 to 3.6 kJ mol               −1               ), and then by GROMOS-54A7, CHARM-CGenFF, and GROMOS-ATB (4.0 to 4.8 kJ mol               −1               ). These differences are statistically significant but not very pronounced, and are distributed rather heterogeneously over the set of compounds within the different force fields.},

We have measured the self-diffusion coefficients of the 50:50\% ethanol-water solution; in the absence of a Pt surface our results show an excellent agreement—within an error of 7.4\%—with the experimental data. An increase in the self-diffusion coefficients with the inclusion of a Pt surface has been observed. The estimation of the diffusion coefficients of both water and ethanol in the presence of a Pt surface shows that they obey the Arrhenius equation; the calculated activation energies of diffusion of ethanol and water are 2.47 and 2.98 Kcal/mole, respectively. The radial distribution function graphs and density profiles have been built; their correlations with the self-diffusion coefficients of both ethanol and water molecules are also illustrated.},

Experimental characterization of both propene and propane diffusivity in ZIF-8 has been provided. Using               2               H NMR spin relaxation analysis, the motional mechanisms for propene and propane guests trapped within the ZIF-8 framework have been elucidated.

  abstract = {Preserving the correct dynamics at the coarse-grained (CG) level is a pressing problem in the development of systematic CG models in soft matter simulation. Starting from the seminal idea of simple time-scale mapping, there have been many efforts over the years toward establishing a meticulous connection between the CG and fine-grained (FG) dynamics based on fundamental statistical mechanics approaches. One of the most successful attempts in this context has been the development of CG models based on the Mori–Zwanzig (MZ) theory, where the resulting equation of motion has the form of a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) and closely preserves the underlying FG dynamics. In this Review, we describe some of the recent studies in this regard. We focus on the construction and simulation of dynamically consistent systematic CG models based on the GLE, both in the simple Markovian limit and the non-Markovian case. Some recent studies of physical effects of memory are also discussed. The Review is aimed at summarizing recent developments in the field while highlighting the major challenges and possible future directions.},

  abstract = {The industries discharge a variety of pollutants, such as heavy metals, organic toxins, and oils, in water resources. Exposure of these contaminants in water causes adverse health effects on various forms of life. Novel materials are needed for the effective removal of pollutants from industrial wastewater. Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets are promising materials for removal of organic pollutants. In this work, the suitability of the sheets for the separation of the ethanol−water mixture is investigated by studying the adsorption and structural behavior of ethanol−water mixtures in slit pores with variable width (7−13 Å) using molecular dynamics simulations. The selectivity of ethanol is found to depend on the pore-width and nature of the pore walls. The selectivity of ethanol is highest for 9 Å pores and lowest for 7 Å pores, irrespective of the nature of the pore walls. However, selectivity of ethanol is relatively higher for hBN pores compared to the graphene pores, for all the considered pore widths. At a lower pore width, molecular sieving plays an important role for selective adsorption of ethanol molecules. On the other hand, at a higher pore width, selective adsorption of ethanol molecules is affected by the nature of the pore walls. The diffusion coefficients of water and ethanol molecules substantially decrease with a decrease in pore width for both graphene and hBN surfaces. The resident time of water and ethanol molecules decreases with increase in the slit-width. Furthermore, water and ethanol molecules confined in hBN pores show higher residence time and lower diffusion coefficient values compared to graphene pores. The adsorption behavior of water and ethanol molecules in the slit pores are analyzed using the potential mean forces, for water and ethanol molecules on the graphene and hBN surfaces, which are determined by umbrella sampling technique.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic relaxation is useful for probing physical and chemical properties of liquids in porous media. Examples are given on high surface area porous materials including calibrated porous silica glasses, granular packings, plaster pastes, cement-based materials and natural porous materials, such as sandstone and carbonate rocks. Here, we outline our recent NMR relaxation work for these very different porous materials. For instance, low field NMR relaxation of water in calibrated granular packings leads to striking different pore-size dependencies of the relaxation times T1 and T2 when changing the amount of surface paramagnetic impurities. This allows separation of the diffusion and surface limited regimes of relaxation in these macroporous media. The magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin–lattice relaxation rate 1/T1(ω0) is also a rich source of dynamical information for characterizing the molecular dynamics of liquids in porous media. This allows a continuous characterization of the evolving microstructure of various cementitious materials. Our recent applications of two-dimensional (2D) T1–T2 and T2-z-store-T2 correlation experiments have evidenced the water exchange in connected micropores of cement pastes. The direct probing of water adsorption time on a solid surface gives access to an original characterization of the surface nano-wettability of porous plaster pastes. We show that such a parameter depends directly on the physical chemistry of the pore surfaces. Lastly, we outline our recent measurements of wettability in oil/brine/reservoir carbonate rocks.},

  abstract = {By saturating forbidden electron‐nuclear double transitions in paramagnetic materials, it is possible to considerably enhance the nuclear polarization in a positive or negative sense. This effect has been investigated experimentally using the protons of water adsorbed on paramagnetic charred sucrose. The dependence of the enhancement on the saturating microwave power is derived for the case of overlapping allowed and forbidden transitions, and predicts a linear change in polarization at low power levels. The general features of the enhancement found are in agreement with those predicted by perturbation theory using a simple dipole‐dipole electron‐nuclear interaction. However, the plot of log (polarization change) vs log (power) has a slope of 0.82±0.04 instead of 1.0. In addition, the field separation between the points of maximum positive and maximum negative enhancement is too small in those chars for which inhomogeneous broadening is suspected.},

  abstract = {Proton spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, at 28 MHz by a recovery from saturation, are reported for very pure water between 0 and 100°C. Our experimental T1 values for water are the longest values which have been observed. In this temperature region the most effective spin-lattice relaxation mechanism in water is by proton dipole-dipole intra- and intermolecular interactions modulated by thermal molecular motion. Measurements for water of dielectric relaxation, X ray diffraction, self diffusion, viscosity and slow neutron inelastic scattering are used in the interpretation of the proton T1 results. The intermolecular contribution to T-11 has been determined with the aid of X ray radial distribution curves and Hubbard's correction for the off-centre proton effect. There is excellent agreement between the temperature dependence of the experimental proton spin-lattice relaxation times and the reciprocals of the dielectric relaxation times. The ratio of the dielectric relaxation time to the molecular reorientation NMR correlation time is found independent of temperature and equal to 3.7 instead of the expected value, three. This result provides an evidence for a small value of the single jump angle in the Brownian reorientation of water molecules and may be accounted for by an internal field correction factor of 0.81. This compares with the value 0.69 obtained for water from the Powles formula.},

  abstract = {The confined dynamics of water molecules inside a pore involves an intermittence between adsorption steps near the interface and surface diffusion and excursions in the pore network. Depending on the strength of the interaction in the layer(s) close to the surface and the dynamical confinement of the distal bulk liquid, exchange dynamics can vary significantly. The average time spent in the surface proximal region (also called the adsorption layer) between a first entry and a consecutive exit allows estimating the level of ‘nanowettablity’ of water. As shown in several seminal works, NMRD is an efficient experimental method to follow such intermittent dynamics close to an interface. In this paper, the intermittent dynamics of a confined fluid inside nanoporous materials is discussed. Special attention is devoted to the interplay between bulk diffusion, adsorption and surface diffusion on curved pore interfaces. Considering the nano or meso length scale confinement of the pore network, an analytical model for calculating the inter-dipolar spin–lattice relaxation dispersion curves is proposed. In the low-frequency regime (50 KHz–100 MHz), this model is successfully compared with numerical simulations performed using a 3D-off lattice reconstruction of Vycor glass. Comparison with experimental data available in the literature is finally discussed.},

  abstract = {Porous materials, concentrated colloidal suspensions are examples of confining systems developing large specific surface and presenting a rich variety of shapes. Such an interfacial confinement strongly influences the molecular dynamics of embedded fluids and the diffusive motion of entrapped Brownian particles. An individual trajectory near the interface can be described as an alternate succession of adsorption steps and random flights in the bulk. Statistical properties of these random flights in various interfacial confining systems are needed as prerequisites in order to understand the full transport process. Related to first passage processes, these properties play a central role in numerous problems such as the mean first exit time in a bounded domain, heterogeneous catalytic reactivity and nuclear magnetic relaxation in complex and biological fluids. In the present work, we first consider the various possibilities of connecting two points of a smooth interface by a random flight in the bulk. Second, we analyse from the theoretical and experimental points of view a way to probe Brownian flight statistics. From the experimental point of view, we investigate the slow fluid dynamics near some colloidal interfaces by field-cycling NMR relaxometry. This is a way to follow slow dynamical correlations from 1 ns to 10 µs. This spectroscopy appears to be a good choice, considering that the algebraic nature of the probability of the first return to a surface builds a long-time memory. The experimental part confirms that the embedded fluid dynamics is sensitive to possible morphologic crossover and provides information about interface geometry. We also believe that such an approach can be used to probe interfacial dynamics by itself, for example in the case of a colloidal system undergoing a phase transition (dynamical arrest, rotational blockage, . . .).},

In the strong-adsorption regime, it was recently proposed that the effective surface diffusion on flat surface is anomalous and exhibits long-time pathology, enlarging the time domain of the embedded-fluid dynamics towards the low-frequency regime. An interesting way to probe such a slow interfacial process is to use the field-cycling NMR relaxometry. This technique is used here to probe the fluid dynamics in two types of interfacial systems: i) a colloidal glass made of thin and flat particles; ii) a fully saturated porous media, the Vycor glass. Experimental results are critically compared to either a simple theoretical model of NMR dispersion involving elementary steps of the fluid dynamics near an interface (loops, trains, tails) or Brownian-dynamics simulations performed inside 3D reconstructions of these confined systems.},

  abstract = {Multiscale modeling of polymers exchanges information between coarse and fine representations of molecules to capture material properties over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Restoring details at a finer scale requires us to generate information following embedded physics and statistics of the models at two different levels of description. Techniques designed to address this persistent challenge balance among accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability. In this work, we present an image-based approach for structural backmapping from coarse-grained to atomistic models with cis-1,4 polyisoprene melts as an illustrative example. Through machine learning, we train conditional generative adversarial networks on the correspondence between configurations at the levels considered. The trained model is subsequently applied to provide predictions of atomistic structures from the input coarse-grained configurations. The effect of different data representation schemes on training and prediction quality is examined. Our proposed backmapping approach shows remarkable efficiency and transferability over different molecular weights in the melt based on training sets constructed from oligomeric compounds. We anticipate that this versatile backmapping approach can be readily extended to other complex systems to provide high-fidelity initial configurations with minimal human intervention.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a structurally simple and nontoxic water-soluble polymer that is widely used in medical and pharmaceutical applications as molecular linker and spacer. In such applications, PEG’s elastic response against conformational deformations is key to its function. According to text-book knowledge, a polymer reacts to the stretching of its end-to-end separation by a decrease in entropy that is due to the reduction of available conformations, which is why polymers are commonly called entropic springs. By a combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments with molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, we show that entropic hydration effects almost exactly compensate the chain conformational entropy loss at high stretching. Our simulations reveal that this entropic compensation is due to the stretching-induced release of water molecules that in the relaxed state form double hydrogen bonds with PEG. As a consequence, the stretching response of PEG is predominantly of energetic, not of entropic, origin at high forces and caused by hydration effects, while PEG backbone deformations only play a minor role. These findings demonstrate the importance of hydration for the mechanics of macromolecules and constitute a case example that sheds light on the antagonistic interplay of conformational and hydration degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {The hydrophobic interaction is significantly responsible for driving protein folding and selfassembly. To understand it, the thermodynamics, the role of water structure, the dewetting process surrounding hydrophobes, and related aspects have undergone extensive investigations. Here, we examine the hypothesis that polymer-solvent interfacial free energy is adequate to describe the energetics of the collapse of a hydrophobic homopolymer chain at fixed temperature, which serves as a much simplified model for studying the hydrophobic collapse of a protein. This implies that changes in polymer-solvent interfacial free energy should be directly proportional to the force to extend a collapsed polymer into a bad solvent. To test this hypothesis, we undertook single-molecule force spectroscopy on a collapsed, single, polystyrene chain in water-ethanol and water-salt mixtures where we measured the monomer solvation free energy from an ensemble average conformations. Different proportions within the binary mixture were used to create solvents with different interfacial free energies with polystyrene. In these mixed solvents, we observed a linear correlation between the interfacial free energy and the force required to extend the chain into solution, which is a direct measure of the solvation free energy per monomer on a single chain at room temperature. A simple analytical model compares favorably with the experimental results. This knowledge supports a common assumption that explicit water solvent may not be necessary for cases whose primary concerns are hydrophobic interactions and hydrophobic hydration.},

The results showed that at high ZIF-8 loading (39 wt \%), a high permeate flux (685 g/ m2 h) and high separation factor (4821) can be observed. Furthermore, compared with free-standing ZIF-8/PVA MMMs, hollow fiber supported ZIF-8/PVA MMMs exhibit a thinner coating thickness but higher pervaporation separation index (approximately 1.5–2 times).

By systematic studies, three distinct causes are elucidated: (i) an unfortunate choice of reference points for the umbrella distance restraint; (ii) a misfit in probability distributions between bound and unbound umbrella windows in case of multiple binding modes; (iii) artifacts introduced by the free energy estimator. Starting with a fully symmetric model system consisting of methane binding to a cylindrical host, complexity is increased through the introduction of dipolar interactions between the host and the solvent, the host and the guest molecule or between all involved species, respectively. The manifestation of artifacts is illustrated and their origin and prevention is discussed. Finally, the consequences for the calculation of standard binding free enthalpies is illustrated using the complexation of primary alcohols with α-cyclodextrin as an example.},

This tendency can be amplified by geometrical nanoconfinement, leading to remarkable properties. This work investigates the molecular dynamics of tert-butanol (TBA)−toluene (TOL) mixtures confined in silica nanochannels by quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulation. It reveals a decoupling of the molecular motion of each constituent of the binary liquid, which can be followed independently by selective isotopic H/D labeling. We argue that this behavior is the signature of spatially segregated dynamic heterogeneities, which are due to the recently established core−shell nanophase separation induced by mesoporous confinement.},

  abstract = {We observe, by computer simulations, a remarkable long-distance, rare, but repetitive, exchange of ethanol molecules between two parallel graphene surfaces in nanoconfined, aqueous, ethanol solutions. We compute the rate of exchange as a function of the separation (d) between the two surfaces. We discover that the initiating (or, the launching) step in this exchange is the attainment of an instantaneous orientation of the carbon–oxygen bond vector relative to the graphene surface. This observation led us to construct a two-dimensional free energy surface for this exchange, with respect to two order parameters, namely, (i) the perpendicular distance of ethanol molecule from the graphene surfaces, z, and (ii) the orientation of the O–C bond vector, θ, of the tagged ethanol molecule. For d = 3~nm, the rate of exchange is found to be 0.44~ns               −1               for the force field used. We also vary the force field and determine the sensitivity of the rate. From the free energy landscape, one could determine the minimum energy pathway. We use both, the transition state theory and Kramers’ theory, to calculate the rate. The calculated rate agrees well with the simulated value as mentioned above. We find that the rate of exchange phenomenon is sensitive to the interaction strength of graphene and the hydrophobic group of ethanol. The free energy landscape exchange shows dependence on the distance separation of the two hydrophobic surfaces and reveals interesting features.},

A bulk-like liquid in the core of the pore and a distinct interfacial region near the pore surface have been identified based on ortho-positronium lifetime components. The lifetime corresponding to the core liquid shows similar behavior to the bulk liquid mixture while the interfacial lifetime shows an abrupt rise within a particular range of ethanol concentration depending on the pore size. This abrupt increase is attributed to the appearance of excess free-volume near the interfacial region. The excess free-volume is originated due to microphase separation of confined ethanol–water primarily at the vicinity of the pore wall. We envisage that probing free-volume changes at the interface using PALS is a sensitive way to investigate microphase separation under nanoconfinement.},

These models of neat water have the same static dielectric constants and similar structural and thermodynamic properties. The methane—water interaction is taken to be exactly the same in both fluids.

  abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is inducing global warming, ocean acidification, polar ice melting, rise in sea level, droughts and hurricanes, thus threatening human health and the global economy. Therefore, there is a need to develop cost-effective technologies for CO2 capture. For instance, solution absorption is promising due to a large processing capacity, high flexibility and reliability, and rich experience in engineering applications. Nonetheless, actual commercial solutions, solvents and processes for CO2 capture suffer from slow reaction kinetics, low absorption capacity, high-energy consumption, susceptibility to corrosion, toxicity, low stability and high costs. Therefore, current research focuses on developing more economical, effective, green and sustainable technologies. Here we review 2015–2020 findings on CO2 capture using liquid absorption methods. Methods are based on various solutions, solvents and processes such as carbonate solution, ammonia solution, amine-based solution, ionic liquid, amino acid salt, phase changing absorbent, microcapsulated and membrane absorption, nanofluids and phenoxide salt solution. We discuss absorption performance, absorption mechanism, enhancement pathways and challenges. Amine- and NH3-based absorbents are widely used, yet they are limited by high regeneration energy, corrosiveness and degradation, reagent loss and secondary pollution caused by NH3 escape. Phase changing absorbents are getting more attention due to their lower cost and lower energy penalty. The incorporation of membrane and microencapsulation technologies to absorbing solvents could enhance CO2 absorption performance by reducing corrosion and increasing selectivity. Adding nanoparticles to solvents could improve CO2 absorption performance and reduce energy requirement. Besides, solvent blends and promoter-improved solvents performed better than single and non-promoted solvents because they combine the benefits of individual solvents and promoters.},

By measuring the elastic constants of ZIF-8 up to the amorphization pressure, we show that the crystal-to-amorphous transition is triggered by the mechanical instability of ZIF-8 under compression, due to shear mode softening of the material. No similar softening was observed under temperature increase, explaining the absence of temperature-induced amorphization in ZIF-8. We also demonstrate the large impact of the presence of adsorbate in the pores on the mechanical stability and compressibility of the framework, increasing its shear stability. This first molecular dynamics study of ZIF mechanical properties under variations of pressure, temperature, and pore filling opens the way to a more comprehensive understanding of their mechanical stability, structural transitions, and amorphization.},

  abstract = {Climate change calls for adaptation of negative emission technologies such as direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) to lower the global warming impacts of greenhouse gases. Recently, elevated global interests to the DAC technologies prompted implementation of new tax credits and new policies worldwide that motivated the existing DAC companies and prompted the startup boom. There are presently 19 DAC plants operating worldwide, capturing more than 0.01 Mt CO2/year. DAC active plants capturing in average 10,000 tons of CO2 annually are still in their infancy and are expensive. DAC technologies still need to improve in three areas: 1) Contactor, 2) Sorbent, and 3) Regeneration to drive down the costs. Technology-based economic development in all three areas are required to achieve {$<\$$}100/ton of CO2 which makes DAC economically viable. Current DAC cost is about 2–6 times higher than the desired cost and depends highly on the source of energy used. In this review, we present the current status of commercial DAC technologies and elucidate the five pillars of technology including capture technologies, their energy demand, final costs, environmental impacts, and political support. We explain processing steps for liquid and solid carbon capture technologies and indicate their specific energy requirements. DAC capital and operational cost based on plant power energy sources, land and water needs of DAC are discussed in detail. At 0.01 Mt CO2/year capture capacity, DAC alone faces a challenge to meet the rates of carbon capture described in the goals of the Paris Agreement with 1.5–2 C of global warming. However, DAC may partially help to offset difficult to avoid annual emissions from concrete (\$8\%), transportation (\$24\%), iron-steel industry (\$11\%), and wildfires (\$0.8\%).},

  abstract = {Filtering through to what's important                            Membranes are widely used for gas and liquid separations. Historical analysis of a range of gas pair separations indicated that there was an upper bound on the trade-off between membrane permeability, which limits flow rates, and the selectivity, which limits the quality of the separation process. Park               et al.               review the advances that have been made in attempts to break past this upper bound. Some inspiration has come from biological membranes. The authors also highlight cases where the challenges lie in areas other than improved separation performance.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaab0530                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Synthetic membranes are used for desalination, dialysis, sterile filtration, food processing, dehydration of air and other industrial, medical, and environmental applications due to low energy requirements, compact design, and mechanical simplicity. New applications are emerging from the water-energy nexus, shale gas extraction, and environmental needs such as carbon capture. All membranes exhibit a trade-off between permeability—i.e., how fast molecules pass through a membrane material—and selectivity—i.e., to what extent the desired molecules are separated from the rest. However, biological membranes such as aquaporins and ion channels are both highly permeable and highly selective. Separation based on size difference is common, but there are other ways to either block one component or enhance transport of another through a membrane. Based on increasing molecular understanding of both biological and synthetic membranes, key design criteria for new membranes have emerged: (i) properly sized free-volume elements (or pores), (ii) narrow free-volume element (or pore size) distribution, (iii) a thin active layer, and (iv) highly tuned interactions between permeants of interest and the membrane. Here, we discuss the permeability/selectivity trade-off, highlight similarities and differences between synthetic and biological membranes, describe challenges for existing membranes, and identify fruitful areas of future research.                                         ADVANCES               Many organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials have emerged as potential membranes. In addition to polymers, used for most membranes today, materials such as carbon molecular sieves, ceramics, zeolites, various nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, graphene oxide, and metal organic frameworks), and their mixtures with polymers have been explored. Simultaneously, global challenges such as climate change and rapid population growth stimulate the search for efficient water purification and energy-generation technologies, many of which are membrane-based. Additional driving forces include wastewater reuse from shale gas extraction and improvement of chemical and petrochemical separation processes by increasing the use of light hydrocarbons for chemicals manufacturing.                                         OUTLOOK               Opportunities for advancing membranes include (i) more mechanically, chemically, and thermally robust materials; (ii) judiciously higher permeability and selectivity for applications where such improvements matter; and (iii) more emphasis on fundamental structure/property/processing relations. There is a pressing need for membranes with improved selectivity, rather than membranes with improved permeability, especially for water purification. Modeling at all length scales is needed to develop a coherent molecular understanding of membrane properties, provide insight for future materials design, and clarify the fundamental basis for trade-off behavior. Basic molecular-level understanding of thermodynamic and diffusion properties of water and ions in charged membranes for desalination and energy applications such as fuel cells is largely incomplete. Fundamental understanding of membrane structure optimization to control transport of minor species (e.g., trace-organic contaminants in desalination membranes, neutral compounds in charged membranes, and heavy hydrocarbons in membranes for natural gas separation) is needed. Laboratory evaluation of membranes is often conducted with highly idealized mixtures, so separation performance in real applications with complex mixtures is poorly understood. Lack of systematic understanding of methodologies to scale promising membranes from the few square centimeters needed for laboratory studies to the thousands of square meters needed for large applications stymies membrane deployment. Nevertheless, opportunities for membranes in both existing and emerging applications, together with an expanding set of membrane materials, hold great promise for membranes to effectively address separations needs.                                                   From intrinsic permeability/selectivity trade-off to practical performance in membranes.                   Polymer membranes for liquid and gas separation applications obey a permeability/selectivity trade-off—highly permeable membranes have low selectivity and vice versa—largely due to broad distributions of free-volume elements (or pores in porous membranes) and nonspecific interactions between small solutes and polymers. We highlight materials approaches to overcome this trade-off, including the development of inorganic, isoporous, mixed matrix, and aquaporin membranes. Further, materials must be processed into thin, typically supported membranes, fashioned into high surface/volume ratio modules, and used in optimized processes. Thus, factors that govern the practical feasibility of membranes such as mechanical strength, module design, and operating conditions are also discussed.                                                                         ,              Increasing demands for energy-efficient separations in applications ranging from water purification to petroleum refining, chemicals production, and carbon capture have stimulated a vigorous search for novel, high-performance separation membranes. Synthetic membranes suffer a ubiquitous, pernicious trade-off: highly permeable membranes lack selectivity and vice versa. However, materials with both high permeability and high selectivity are beginning to emerge. For example, design features from biological membranes have been applied to break the permeability-selectivity trade-off. We review the basis for the permeability-selectivity trade-off, state-of-the-art approaches to membrane materials design to overcome the trade-off, and factors other than permeability and selectivity that govern membrane performance and, in turn, influence membrane design.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented to identify the truly interfacial molecules at fluid/fluid interfaces seen at molecular resolution, a situation that regularly occurs in computer simulations. In the new method, the surface is scanned by moving a probe sphere of a given radius along a large set of test lines that are perpendicular to the plane of the interface. The molecules that are hit by the probe spheres are regarded as interfacial ones, and the position of the test spheres when they are in contact with the interfacial molecules give an estimate of the surface. The dependence of the method on various parameters, in particular, on the size of the probe sphere is discussed in detail. Based on the list of molecules identified as truly interfacial ones, two measures of the molecular scale roughness of the surface are proposed. The bivariate distribution of the lateral and normal distances of two points of the interface provides a full description of the molecular scale morphology of the surface in a statistical sense. For practical purposes two parameters related to the dependence of the average normal distance of two surface points on their lateral distance can be used. These two parameters correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the surface roughness, respectively. The new method is applied for the analysis of the molecular level structure of the liquid–vapor interface of water. As an immediate result of the application of the new method it is shown that the orientational preferences of the interfacial water molecules depend only on the local curvature of the interface, and hence the molecules located at wells of concave curvature of the rippled surface prefer the same orientations as waters located at the surface of small apolar solutes. The vast majority of the truly interfacial molecules are found to form a strongly percolating two-dimensional hydrogen bonded network at the surface, whereas no percolation is observed within the second molecular layer beyond the surface.},

To circumvent this difficulty, deuteron spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times in lysozyme powder hydrated with deuterium oxide were measured as a function of temperature and at two frequencies. Although the deuteron relaxation results are compatible with a water molecule dynamics model based on either a bimodal distribution of correlation times or anisotropic motion, a comparison of the present results with proton data suggests than an anisotropic motion model is more likely to provide a reasonable description of the water molecule motion. An analysis based on an anisotropic motion model that uses two correlation times to characterize the motion shows that most of the water molecules rotate about their twofold axis of symmetry at a rate that is only -100 times smaller than the rate of isotropic diffusion in the bulk liquid. The reorientation of the twofold axis of symmetry itself is characterized by a correlation time of 10-7 S.},

  abstract = {Comparatively small molecules such as peptides can show a high internal mobility with transitions between several conformational minima and sometimes coupling between rotational and internal degrees of freedom. In those cases the interpretation of NMR relaxation data is difficult and the use of standard methods for structure determination is questionable. On the other hand, in the case of those system sizes, the timescale of both rotational and internal motions is accessible by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using explicit solvent. Thus a comparison of distance averages ( r−6 −1/6 or r−3 1/3) over the MD trajectory with NOE (or ROE) derived distances is no longer necessary, the (back)calculation of the complete spectra becomes possible. In the present study we use two 200 ns trajectories of a heptapeptide of β-amino acids in methanol at two different temperatures to obtain theoretical ROESY spectra by calculating the exact spectral densities for the interproton vectors and the full relaxation matrix. Those data are then compared with the experimental ones. This analysis permits to test some of the assumptions and approximations that generally have to be made to interpret NMR spectra, and to make a more reliable prediction of the conformational equilibrium that leads to the experimental spectrum.},

  abstract = {Fluids confined in nanopores exhibit several unique structural and dynamical characteristics that affect a number of applications in industry as well as natural phenomena. Understanding and predicting the complex fluid behavior under nano-confinement is therefore of key importance, and both experimental and computational approaches have been employed toward this goal. It is now feasible to employ both simulations and theoretical methods, the results of which can be validated by cutting-edge experimental quantification. Nevertheless, predicting fluid transport through heterogeneous pore networks at a scale large enough to be relevant for practical applications remains elusive because one should account for a variety of fluid–rock interactions, a wide range of confined fluid states, as well as pore-edge effects and the existence of preferential pathways, which, together with many other phenomena, affect the results. The aim of this Review is to overview the significance of molecular phenomena on fluid transport in nanoporous media, the capability and shortcomings of both molecular and continuum fluid modeling approaches, and recent progress in multiscale modeling of fluid transport. In our interpretation, a multiscale approach couples a molecular picture for fluid interactions with solid surfaces at the single nanopore level with hierarchical transport analysis through realistic heterogeneous pore networks to balance physical accuracy with computational expense. When possible, comparison against experiments is provided as a guiding roadmap for selecting the appropriate computational methods. The appropriateness of an approach is certainly related to the final application of interest, as different sectors will require different levels of precision in the predictions.},

  abstract = {The sorptivity, structure, and dynamics of liquid water–ethanol mixtures confined in alumina pores were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. Due to an effective stronger attraction between water and the alumina surface, our simulations show that water is preferentially adsorbed in alumina nanopores from bulk solutions of varying composition. These results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data reported by Rao and Sircar (Adsorpt. Sci. Technol. 1993, 10, 93). Analysis of the simulated trajectories allows us to predict that water diffuses through the narrow pores more easily than ethanol, in part because of its smaller size. Our results suggest that ethanol has an antiplasticization effect on water within the narrow pores considered here, whereas it has a plasticization effect on water in the bulk. Rao and Sircar suggested that alumina could be used in concentration swing and/or concentration-thermal swing adsorption processes to separate water from ethanol. In addition, our results suggest the possibility of using alumina for manufacturing permselective membranes to produce anhydrous ethanol from liquid water–ethanol solutions.},

When mixed in small concentrations with water or alkanes, it forms aggregate structures reminiscent of, respectively, the direct and inverse micellar aggregates found in emulsions, albeit at much smaller sizes. At higher concentrations, micro-heterogeneous mixing with segregated domains is found. We examine how different statistical methods, namely correlation function analysis, structure factor analysis and cluster distribution analysis, can describe efficiently these morphological changes in these mixtures. In particular, we explain how the neat alcohol pre-peak of the structure factor evolves into the domain pre-peak under mixing conditions, and how this evolution differs whether the co-solvent is water or alkane. This study clearly establishes the heuristic superiority of the correlation function/structure factor analysis to study the micro-heterogeneity, since cluster distribution analysis is insensitive to domain segregation. Correlation functions detect the domains, with a clear structure factor pre-peak signature, while the cluster techniques detect the cluster hierarchy within domains. The main conclusion is that, in micro-segregated mixtures, the domain structure is a more fundamental statistical entity than the underlying cluster structures. These findings could help better understand comparatively the radiation scattering experiments, which are sensitive to domains,               versus               the spectroscopy-NMR experiments, which are sensitive to clusters.},

  abstract = {The behavior of water, methanol, and water-methanol mixtures confined in narrow slit graphite pores as a function of pore size was investigated by Monte Carlo, hybrid Monte Carlo, and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Interactions were described using TIP4P/2005 for water, OPLS/2016 for methanol, and cross interactions fitted to excess water/methanol properties over the whole range of concentrations, which provide a rather accurate description of water-methanol mixtures. As expected for hydrophobic pores, whereas pure methanol is adsorbed already from the gas phase, pure water only enters the pore at pressures well beyond bulk saturation for all pore sizes considered. When adsorbed from a mixture, however, water adsorbs at much lower pressures due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with previously adsorbed methanol molecules. For all studied compositions and pore sizes, methanol adsorbs preferentially over water at liquid-vapor equilibrium conditions. In pure components, both water and methanol are microscopically structured in layers, the number of layers increasing with pore size. This is also the case in adsorbed mixtures, in which methanol has a higher affinity for the walls. This becomes more evident as the pore widens. Diffusion of pure water is higher than that of pure methanol for all pore sizes due to the larger size of the methyl group. In mixtures, both components present similar diffusivities at all pore sizes, which is explained in terms of the coupling of molecular movements due to strong hydrogen bonding between methanol and water molecules. This is particularly evident in very narrow pores, in which pure methanol diffusion is completely impeded on the time scale of our simulations, but the presence of a small amount of water molecules facilitates alcohol diffusion following a single-file mechanism. Additionally, our results indicate that pure water diffusivities display a non-monotonous dependence of pore size, due to effects of confinement (proximity to a fluid-solid-fluid transition induced by confinement as reported in previous work) and the dynamic anomalies of water.},

It is shown that the WTPI method fails to accurately compute the chemical potentials of water and methanol in the liquid phase at low temperatures, while accurate chemical potentials in the liquid phase are computed using CFCGE MC method. For the CFCGE MC method, the statistical uncertainty for computed chemical potentials of water and methanol in the liquid phase are considerably smaller compared to the WTPI method. For the water models considered in this study (SPC, TIP3P-EW, TIP4P-EW, TIP5P-EW), computed excess chemical potentials based on three-site models are in better agreement with the chemical potentials computed from an empirical equation of state from the NIST database. For water, orientational biasing is applied during test particle insertion to check whether certain orientations of test particle are energetically unfavourable. A two-dimensional Overlapping Distribution Method (ODM) in the NVT ensemble is derived for this purpose. It is shown that failure of the WTPI method for systems with a strong hydrogen bonding network does not depend on orientation of the test molecule in that system. For all systems in this study, the WTPI method breaks down when the void fraction of the system drops below approximately 0.50.},

However, it is still unclear how the trichome of T. landbeckii and other Tillandsia species is able to absorb fine water droplets during intermittent fog events while also preventing evaporation when the plant is exposed to the desert’s hyperarid conditions. Here, we explain how a 5800-fold asymmetry in water conductance arises from a clever juxtaposition of a thick hygroscopic wall and a semipermeable membrane. While absorption is achieved by osmosis of liquid water, evaporation under dry external conditions shifts the liquid-gas interface forcing water to diffuse through the thick trichome wall in the vapor phase. We confirm this mechanism by fabricating artificial composite membranes mimicking the trichome structure. The reliance on intrinsic material properties instead of moving parts makes the trichome a promising basis for the development of microfluidics valves.},

J. 2011, 40, 843−856] and involves a recalibration of the nonbonded interaction parameters for the charged amino acid side chains, based on ionic side chain analogs. After a thorough analysis of the available experimental data, conventional hydration free energies for the ammonium; mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; formate; acetate; propanoate; imidazolium; and guanidinium ions are combined with a standard absolute intrinsic proton hydration free energy ΔGh⊖yd[Hg+] = −1100 kJ·mol−1 to yield absolute intrinsic single-ion hydration free energies serving as experimental target data. The raw hydration free energies calculated from atomistic simulations are affected by electrostatic and finite-size artifacts, and corrections are applied to reach methodological independence prior to comparison with these experimental values. Except for monomethyl-ammonium, ions with parameters derived directly from the 54A7 force field considerably underestimate (ammonium, formate, acetate, propanoate, guanidinium) or overestimate (di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; imidazolium) the magnitude of the intrinsic hydration free energy, the largest deviation affecting the acetate ion (40.0 kJ·mol−1). After reparameterization into 54A8, the mean and maximal absolute deviations between simulated and experimental data over the set of 10 ions are reduced from 23.1 and 40.0 kJ·mol−1, respectively, to 1.8 and 6.3 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Although the 54A7 and 54A8 parameter sets differ significantly in terms of the hydration free energies of the ions considered, other properties such as ion−water radial distribution functions and ion−ion potentials of mean force appear to be only moderately sensitive to this change. These properties are similar for the two sets and, in the case of the ion−water radial distribution functions, in good agreement with available experimental data.},

Here, we argue that artificial ionic machines can be designed by harnessing the entire wealth of phenomena available at the nanoscales and exploiting techniques developed in various fields of physics. As they are generally based on solid-state nanopores, rather than soft membranes and proteins, they should, in particular, aim at taking advantage of their specific properties, such as their electronic structure or their ability to interact with light. These observations call for the design of new ways of probing nanofluidic systems.

  abstract = {Water–methane clusters are stable at low temperatures as those found in Mars. Water cages enveloping methane are stable, although they present small probability to occur.           ,                             Characterization of hydrogen bonds in CH               4               –(H               2               O)               12               clusters was carried out by using several quantum chemistry tools. An initial stochastic search provided around 2\,500\,000 candidate structures, then, using a convex-hull polygon criterion followed by gradient based optimization under the Kohn–Sham scheme, a total of 54 well defined local minima were located in the Potential Energy Surface. These structures were further analyzed through second-order many-body perturbation theory with an extended basis set at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. Our analysis of Gibbs energies at several temperatures clearly suggests a structural preference toward compact water clusters interacting with the external methane molecule, instead of the more commonly known clathrate-like structures. This study shows that CH               4               –(H               2               O)               12               clusters may be detected at temperatures up to 179 K, this finding provides strong support to a recently postulated hypothesis that suggests that methane–water clusters could be present in Mars at these conditions. Interestingly, we found that water to water hydrogen bonding is strengthened in the mixed clusters when compared to the isolated water dimer, which in turn leads to a weakening of the methane to water hydrogen bonding when compared to the CH               4               –(H               2               O) dimer. Finally, our evidence places a stern warning about the abilities of popular geometrical criteria to determine the existence of hydrogen bonds.},

  abstract = {This contribution reviews our recent investigations into the dielectric relaxation behavior of methanol/water (MW), ethanol/water (EW), 1-propanol/water (1PW), and 2-propanol/water (2PW) mixtures. The analysis of the complex permittivity spectra measured in the frequency range 0.1Vm/GHzV89 reveals that in the alcohol-rich region of \textasciitilde 0.3VXAV1.0, where XA is the mole fraction of alcohol, a three-step relaxation model is most appropriate for the description of the spectra whereas at low XA the intermediate process becomes too small to be resolved. The dominating low-frequency Cole–Cole (CC) dispersion ( j=1) is assigned to the cooperative dynamics of the H-bond system where the motions of alcohol and water molecules cannot be distinguished. Its time scale is largely governed by the number density of H-bond acceptor and donor sites but steric effects also contribute. Two additional Debye (D) terms ( j=2 and j=3) with relaxation times of s2\textasciitilde 10–20 ps and s3\textasciitilde 1–2 ps are required to reproduce the high-frequency part of the spectrum. These small-amplitude dispersion steps can be assigned to the motion of singly H-bonded alcohol monomers at the ends of the chain structure ( j=2) and to the flipping motion of free OH ( j=3). The increase of the amplitude De2 and the simultaneous decrease of the (effective) dipole–dipole correlation factor with decreasing XA in \textasciitilde 0.5VXAV1.0 suggests insertion of water molecules into the zigzag structure of H-bonded alcohol chains inducing a reduction of the average chain length and an increase of the number of end-standing alcohol molecules that can contribute to the s2-mode.},

Here we show that mono- and multilayers of graphene, conforming to heterogeneous monolayers of molecules in a flexible slit pore between a mica surface and the graphene layers, allow for mapping the phase separation of water and ethanol within such a slit pore. Employing scanning force microscopy, we readily distinguish clusters of ethanol and water molecules due their different sizes, and we show that the phase separated water−ethanol structures become coarser under thicker graphenes. Moreover, we obtain a lower bound for the two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of ethanol in water of D ≥ 2 × 10−14 m2 s−1. Thus, the molecularly thin slit pore provides a powerful tool to control and to investigate mixed fluids in self-adjusting nanopores.},

Employing scanning force microscopy of the graphene layers conforming to the molecular films we quantify the patterns using the ethanol−water cross correlation and the autocorrelation of domain wall directions. They reveal that lateral pattern dimensions grow and the domain walls stiffen upon increasing the thickness of the graphene multilayers. We attribute the control of the patterns through the graphene layers to the competition between the mechanical deformation energy of the graphene sheets and the electrostatic repulsion of dipoles normal to the interface. The latter results from charge transfer between graphene and the molecules confined between mica and graphene.},

  abstract = {This review discusses the cryogenic capture system from the perspective of constructing new cryogenic capture system structures, exploring the optimal system parameters, and analyzing the challenges faced by different cryogenic capture systems. The gas that needs to remove CO2 undergoes desulfurization, denitrification and dust removal treatment, which can effectively reduce impurities and remove, and ensure the progress of the subsequent carbon capture process. Among the cryogenic technologies of carbon capture, cryogenic distillation is restricted by the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the gas and cost, and it cannot be widely popularized. Cryogenic condensation offers a wide range of industrial applications because it may immediately liquefy CO2 for oil displacement. Currently, the most concerned cryogenic sublimation can capture low-concentration CO2 at a rate of 99.9\% at 13.5~vol\%, and energy consumption and annual investment costs can also be effectively reduced. In general, cryogenic CO2 capture technology provides remarkable cost and efficiency benefits compared with other carbon capture technologies. By 2030, China’s CO2 capture cost will be 13–57\$/t, and it will be 3–19\$/t in 2060. Combining fixed costs and operating costs, the total abatement cost is 65\$/t CO2, which is similar to the cost of 54\$/ton CO2 in Japan and 60–193\$/t CO2 in Australia. By 2060, the carbon emission reduction ratio of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) will account for about 10\% of the total emission reduction, so the research on CCUS is very urgent. It must break through the extreme utilization of cold energy and energy consumption barriers as well as increase the efficiency of the system.},

  abstract = {Nanoporous carbons, as promising adsorbents for CO2 capture and separation from flue gas, span the major challenge of optimizing the physicochemical property to meet the need of CO2 capture and separation. Herein, we rationally engineered sustainable nanoporous carbons with tailorable porosity and rich surface chemistry using an activating agent of small-molecule organic acids. The porosity could be easily tailored by varying the activation temperature and activator dosage. The surface chemistry and morphology could be tuned by changing the dopant concentration. In detail, porosity played a determinant role in CO2 adsorption capacity, especially ultramicroporosity. Narrow micropores brought major contributions to CO2 uptake at low pressure, while mesopores played a great role at high adsorption pressure. Surface chemistry played a critical role in CO2 capture, especially adsorption selectivity and the isosteric heat of adsorption when the ultramicroporosity was optimal. We revealed that the C–OH group (one type of oxygen-containing species) made a relatively high contribution for improving CO2 capture by hydrogen bonding. For nitrogen-containing groups, the pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and amine groups provoked more improvements in CO2 capture by offering more basic CO2-philic sites, while the oxidized-N group made a weak influence. Sheet-like structures exhibited more accessible affine sites for fast CO2 capture and separation. We proposed a valuable reference for rationally engineering nanoporous carbons with the optimal texture to meet the different requirements of CO2 capture. More importantly, the conversion of biowaste into high-added-value adsorbents for effective CO2 capture and separation opened up an elegant route of killing two birds with one stone.},

Likewise, the translational diffusion DT coefficients calculated using simulation configurations agree with measured diffusion data at ambient conditions. The agreement between the predicted and experimentally measured NMR relaxation times and diffusion coefficient also validate the forcefields used in the simulation. The molecular simulations naturally separate intramolecular from intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions helping bring new insight into the two NMR relaxation mechanisms as a function of molecular chain-length (i.e. carbon number). Comparison of the MD simulation results of the two relaxation mechanisms with traditional hard-sphere models used in interpreting NMR data reveals important limitations in the latter. With increasing chain length, there is substantial deviation in the molecular size inferred on the basis of the radius of gyration from simulation and the fitted hard-sphere radii required to rationalize the relaxation times. This deviation is characteristic of the local nature of the NMR measurement, one that is well-captured by molecular simulations.},

The simulated diffusion-coefficients agree well with measurements, without any adjustable parameters in the interpretation of the simulations. A minimization technique is developed to compute the angular velocity for non-rigid spherical molecules, which is used to simulate the autocorrelation function for spin-rotation interactions. With increasing diffusivity, the autocorrelation function shows increasing deviations from the single-exponential decay predicted by the Langevin theory for rigid spheres, and the deviations are quantified using inverse Laplace transforms. The 1H spin-rotation relaxation rate derived from the autocorrelation function using the “kinetic model” agrees well with measurements in the supercritical/gas phase, while the relaxation rate derived using the “diffusion model” agrees well with measurements in the liquid phase. 1H spin-rotation relaxation is shown to dominate over the MD-simulated 1H-1H dipole-dipole relaxation at high diffusivity, while the opposite is found at low diffusivity. At high diffusivity, the simulated spin-rotation correlation time agrees with the kinetic collision time for gases, which is used to derive a new expression for 1H spin-rotation relaxation, without any adjustable parameters.},

  abstract = {We present well-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations of a large-scale reverse osmosis membranespacer configuration (∼ 1 m). Our computational model solves the flow and transport equations with variable solute-dependent properties. We utilize a high resolution computational mesh to resolve all relevant length scales associated with spacer-induced mixing and thin concentration boundary layers. An important contribution of this work is the development of a modified mass-transfer correlation that accounts for the development of the concentration boundary layer along the channel. A set of 2D axisymmetric simulations were performed for a spiral wound module layer with varying cross-flow conditions and spacer diameters which indicate a significant entrance length effect for concentration profile development at lower flow rates while mixing effects dominate at higher flow rates. The mass-transfer correlations at higher flow rates compare well with published correlations while a surrogate model for Sherwood number was obtained that depends on an additional similarity variable that accounted for entrance length effects at lower flow rates. Finally, a large-scale membrane-spacer design relevant to high-pressure reverse osmosis is studied with a non-uniform arrangement of spacers, which indicate a substantial saving in pressure drop (∼ 40\%) compared to traditional uniformly spaced pattern with minor variations (∼ 2\%) in concentration polarization, product water quality (∼ 1\%) and water recovery (∼ 7\%) compared to a uniform spacer pattern.},

Both methanol and IPA molecules showed a strong preference to gather at various interfaces, with methanol molecules also showing a tendency to diffuse into the droplet bulk. Specific interfacial tensions were investigated using quasi-one-dimensional simulation systems, and liquid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial tensions were found to decrease greatly due to the presence of interfacial alcohol, while solid-vapor interfacial tensions were proved to have little influence on wettability. Young's relation was found to hold quantitatively well for both water-methanol and water-IPA droplets. The validity of using Bakker's equation on solid-liquid interfaces was also investigated, and it was shown that for tightly spaced crystal surfaces, the introduced uncertainly is small.},

Because of the complexity of the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying atomic-level tribology, it is still not possible to accurately and reliably predict the response when two surfaces come into contact at the nanoscale. Fundamental scientific studies are the means by which these insights may be gained. We review recent advances in the experimental, theoretical and computational studies of nanotribology.

This is a major advantage in dense phases where the Widom method, usually employed in Metropolis MC, fails to provide sufficient accuracy. We have studied binary mixtures of methane with ethane to illustrate the consistency between the simulation methods for bulk fluids, and mixtures of ethanol–water and ammonia-water as examples of adsorption systems. The adsorption systems exhibit cooperative effects between water and ethanol and between water and ammonia: water by itself does not wet a carbon surface, but it adsorbs in large quantities when either ethanol or ammonia are present. Microscopic configurations taken from the simulations show a distinct difference between the adsorption mechanism in the water/ethanol mixtures and the water/ammonia mixtures.},

In the current review we explore two distinct research areas. Namely, we discuss the self-diffusion of water in the bulk phase and under confinement. Different aspects that affect the diffusion process, including the molecular models, the system-size effects, the temperature and pressure conditions and the type of confinement are discussed.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics studies have demonstrated that molecular water at an interface, with either a gas or a solid, displays anisotropic orientational behavior in contrast to its bulk counterpart. This effect has been recently implicated in the like-charge attraction problem for colloidal particles in solution. Here, negatively charged particles in solution display a long-ranged attraction where continuum electrostatic theory predicts monotonically repulsive interactions, particularly in solutions with monovalent salt ions at low ionic strength. Anisotropic orientational behavior of solvent molecules at an interface gives rise to an excess interfacial electrical potential which we suggest generates an additional solvation contribution to the total free energy that is traditionally overlooked in continuum descriptions of interparticle interactions in solution. In the present investigation we perform molecular dynamics simulation based calculations of the interfacial potential using realistic surface models representing various chemistries as well as different solvents. Similar to previous work that focused on simple model surfaces constructed by using oxygen atoms, we find that solvents at more realistic model surfaces exhibit substantial anisotropic orientational behavior. We explore the dependence of the interfacial solvation potential on surface properties such as surface group chemistry and group density at silica and carboxylated polystyrene interfaces. For water, we note surprisingly good agreement between results obtained for a simple O-atom wall and more complex surface models, suggesting a general qualitative consistency of the interfacial solvation effect for surfaces in contact with water. In contrast, for an aprotic solvent such as DMSO, surface chemistry appears to exert a stronger influence on the sign and magnitude of the interfacial solvation potential. The study carries broad implications for molecular-scale interactions and may find relevance in explaining a range of phenomena in softmatter physics and cell biology.},

The MOF glass membrane was fabricated by melt-quenching treatment of an in situ solvothermally synthesized polycrystalline ZIF-62 MOF membrane on a porous ceramic alumina support. The molten ZIF-62 phase penetrated into the nanopores of the support and eliminated the formation of intercrystalline defects in the resultant glass membrane. The molecular sieving ability of the MOF membrane is remarkably enhanced via vitrification. The separation factors of the MOF glass membrane for H2/CH4, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures are 50.7, 34.5, and 36.6, respectively, far exceeding the Robeson upper bounds.},

  abstract = {Metal−organic frameworks are promising nanoporous materials for adsorption heat pumps (AHPs) using water and alcohols as working fluids due to their ultrahigh surface area. The heat transfer in porous crystals containing adsorbed gases is vital for their performance in adsorbed natural gas storage or AHPs. However, limited attention has been paid to their thermal properties. In this study, equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the impacts of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). The results demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 increased from 0.165 to 0.319 W m−1 K−1 with the increased number of adsorbed ethanol molecules. On the contrary, the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 upon water adsorption is approximately 0.190 W m−1 K−1, which is not significantly affected by the number of adsorbed water molecules. Such a different tendency may be ascribed to the different interaction strengths between ZIF-8 and gas molecules. In addition, the larger overlap energy in the vibrational density of state of ZIF-8/ethanol than that of ZIF-8/ water also correlates with the higher thermal conductivity of the ZIF-8/ethanol system. This work provides molecular insights into the effects of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8, which may inspire further exploration of novel techniques to improve the heat transfer performance of practical applications.},

Pressure–hydration curves obtained               via               sorption experiments reveal that the repulsion significantly increases when the membranes are loaded with co-solutes, most strongly for TMAO. As a result, the co-solutes retain additional water molecules and therefore provide membranes with a fluid and more physiological environment. The experimental data are quantitatively reproduced in complementary solvent-explicit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, which yield the chemical potential of water. Simulation analysis reveals that the additional repulsion arises from the osmotic pressure generated by the co-solutes, an effect which is maximal for TMAO, due to its unfavorable interactions with the lipid headgroup layer and its extraordinarily high osmotic coefficient.},

  abstract = {Ion-specific induced changes of the ζ-potential of phospholipid vesicles are commonly used to quantify the affinity of different ions to the lipid interface. The negative ζ-potential of zwitterionic net-neutral phospholipid vesicles in neat water, which changes sign and increases in solutions of NaCl or KCl, is a phenomenon consistently observed in experiments but not fully understood theoretically. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of applied electric fields which drive electroosmotic flows, in combination with an electrostatic continuum model based on the modified Poisson−Boltzmann and Helmholtz−Smoluchowski equations, we study the electrokinetic and electrostatic properties as well as the specific ion affinities to the phospholipid−water interface, in order to resolve these puzzling observations. Our modified continuum equations account for the dielectric profile at the lipid−water interface, ion-specific interactions between ions and the lipid−water interface, and the interfacial viscosity profile, which are all extracted from our atomistic simulations and rather accurately predict ion-density and electrostatic-potential distributions as well as ζ-potentials in comparison with our atomistic simulations. Our continuum model can explain experimental ζ-potentials only when we assume minute amounts of surface-active anionic impurities in the aqueous solution. In fact, the amount of impurities needed to explain the experimental data increases linearly with the salt concentration, suggesting that surface-active species, which might be already present in the lab water or lipid samples, could further be introduced through the added salt.},

  abstract = {Fundamental understanding of small molecule−silica surface interactions at their interfaces is essential for the scientific, technological, and medical communities. We report direct enthalpy of adsorption (Δhads) measurements for ethanol and water vapor on porous silica glass (CPG-10), in both hydroxylated and dehydroxylated (hydrophobic) forms. The results suggest a spectrum of energetics as a function of coverage, stepwise for ethanol but continuous for water. The zero-coverage enthalpy of adsorption for hydroxylated silica shows the most exothermic enthalpies for both water (−72.7 ± 3.1 kJ/mol water) and ethanol (−78.0 ± 1.9 kJ/mol ethanol). The water adsorption enthalpy becomes less exothermic gradually until reaching its only plateau (−20.7 ± 2.2 kJ/mol water) reflecting water clustering on a largely hydrophobic surface, while the enthalpy of ethanol adsorption profile presents two well separated plateaus, corresponding to strong chemisorption of ethanol on adsorbate-free silica surface (−66.4 ± 4.8 kJ/mol ethanol), and weak physisorption of ethanol on ethanol covered silica (−4.0 ± 1.6 kJ/mol ethanol). On the other hand, dehydroxylation leads to missing water−silica interactions, whereas the number of ethanol binding sites is not impacted. The isotherms and partial molar properties of adsorption suggest that water may only bind strongly onto the silanols (which are a minor species on silica glass), whereas ethanol can interact strongly with both silanols and the hydrophobic areas of the silica surface.},

The parameters for the 2-methyl imidazole (MeIM) ring are adopted from the AMBER force field, while the van der Waals (VDW) parameters for organic linkers and metal centers were determined by rescaling the UFF parameters as               ε               = 0.635               ε               UFF               and               σ               = 1.0               σ               UFF               to fit the CH               4               adsorption isotherms obtained by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with the force field parameters to the experimental ones. The CH               4               adsorption isotherms on four different structures of ZIF-8 at 298 K obtained by GCMC simulations are compared with the experimental data. The results show that the simulated CH               4               adsorption isotherms on the ZIF-8 structure reported from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) are closest to the ones on the ZIF-8 structure from the report of Moggach               et al.               To test our model, adsorption isotherms of CH               4               , H               2               , CO               2               and N               2               at different temperatures were computed using GCMC simulations, and the results were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. In the case of H               2               , the equilibrium configurations obtained by GCMC simulations were statistically analyzed with ad hoc code to get probability density distribution profiles. These profiles were transformed to visual slice images, which indicate that the preferential adsorption sites of H               2               molecules in ZIF-8 are located close to the MeIM rings, where the host–guest VDW or electrostatic interactions are maximal, as revealed by the potential energy surfaces (PES). In addition, these force field parameters were confirmed to well reproduce the ZIF-8 structural properties including lattice constants, bond lengths and angles over a wide range of temperatures. The self-diffusivities at the specific loadings of adsorbed gases (CH               4               , H               2               and CO               2               ) in ZIF-8 were calculated by the mean squared displacement (MSD) method. It was found that our self-diffusivities of H               2               are slightly higher than the ones in the literature, and our self-diffusivity of CO               2               is as about three times as the one in the literature, due to the different partial charges and the effect of different force field parameters on framework shape and flexibility in our simulations.},

  abstract = {A methodology based on the combination of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and expanded ensemble (EE) simulations has been used to study the adsorption of alcohols from dilute aqueous solution onto the silicalite zeolite. The chemical potential of the guest alcohol molecules in bulk aqueous solutions is calculated by the EE method, and the adsorption isotherms of the alcohols are calculated using GCMC simulations. This approach results in adsorption isotherms that relate the loadings to external concentrations without using an equation of state, experimental data, or performing computationally expensive simulations such as two-phase Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). Also, the method is “force-field-consistent”, in that the same force field is used for the bulk fluid and the adsorption calculations, and the resulting isotherms can be directly compared with experimental data. We have established the validity of the method used by comparing the calculated adsorption isotherms with experimental data for methanol and ethanol on silicalite, both from aqueous solution and from the vapor phase. Calculated heats of adsorption are also in reasonable agreement with experimental data. In addition, these simulations provide information on the location of the alcohol adsorption sites. We also observe that the presence of water increases the adsorption of alcohols at dilute concentrations onto silicalite; therefore, an accurate estimate of amount of water adsorbed in the nanoporous substrate is important to the prediction of alcohol adsorption from aqueous solution. The method presented here can be used to study the adsorption of any molecular species on any nanoporous adsorbent.},

  abstract = {Heavy oil (bitumen) is characterized by its high viscosity and density, which is a major obstacle to both well logging and recovery. Due to the lost information of T2 relaxation time shorter than echo spacing (TE) and interference of water signal, estimation of heavy oil properties from NMR T2 measurements is usually problematic. In this work, a new method has been developed to overcome the echo spacing restriction of NMR spectrometer during the application to heavy oil (bitumen). A FID measurement supplemented the start of CPMG. Constrained by its initial magnetization (M0) estimated from the FID and assuming log normal distribution for bitumen, the corrected T2 relaxation time of bitumen sample can be obtained from the interpretation of CPMG data. This new method successfully overcomes the TE restriction of the NMR spectrometer and is nearly independent on the TE applied in the measurement. This method was applied to the measurement at elevated temperatures (8-90 degrees C). Due to the significant signal-loss within the dead time of FID, the directly extrapolated M0 of bitumen at relatively lower temperatures ({$<$}60 degrees C) was found to be underestimated. However, resulting from the remarkably lowered viscosity, the extrapolated M0 of bitumen at over 60 degrees C can be reasonably assumed to be the real value. In this manner, based on the extrapolation at higher temperatures ({$>$} or = 60 degrees C), the M0 value of bitumen at lower temperatures ({$<$}60 degrees C) can be corrected by Curie's Law. Consequently, some important petrophysical properties of bitumen, such as hydrogen index (HI), fluid content and viscosity were evaluated by using corrected T2.},

  abstract = {We employ the popular all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulations, OPLSAA, force-field to model 17 different alcohols in the liquid state. Using the standard simulation protocol for few hundred nanosecond time periods, we find that 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol undergo spontaneous transition to a crystalline state at temperatures which are 35−55 K higher than the experimental melting temperatures. Nevertheless, the crystal structures obtained from the simulations are very similar to those determined by X-ray powder diffraction data for several n-alcohols. Although some degree of deviations from the experimental freezing points are to be expected, for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol, the elevation of the freezing temperature warrants special attention because at room temperature, these alcohols are liquids; however, if simulated by the OPLSAA force-field, they will crystallize. This behavior is likely a consequence of exaggerated attractive interactions between the alkane chains of the alcohols. To circumvent this problem, we combined the OPLSAA model with the L-OPLS force-field. We adopted the L-OPLS parameters to model the hydrocarbon tail of the alcohols, whereas the hydroxyl head group remained as in the original OPLSAA force-field. The resulting alcohols stayed in the liquid state at temperatures above their experimental melting points, thus, resolving the enhanced freezing observed with the OPLSAA force-field. In fact, the mixed-model alcohols did not exhibit any spontaneous freezing even at temperatures much lower than the experimental values. However, a series of simulations in which these mixed-OPLSAA alcohols started from a coexistence configuration of the liquid and solid phases resulted in freezing transitions at temperatures 14−25 K lower than the experimental values, confirming the validity of the proposed model. For all of the other alcohols, the mixed model yields results very similar to the OPLSAA force-field and is in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, for simulating alcohols in the liquid phase, the mixed-OPLSAA model is necessary for large (7 carbons and above) hydrocarbon chains.},

  abstract = {Water and ethanol vapor adsorption phenomena are investigated systematically on a series of MFI-type zeolites: silicalite-1 samples synthesized via both alkaline (OH−) and fluoride (F−) routes, and ZSM-5 samples with different Si/Al ratios as well as different chargebalancing cations. Full isotherms (0.05−0.95 activity) over the range 25− 55 °C are presented, and the lowest total water uptake ever reported in the literature is shown for silicalite-1 made via a fluoride-mediated route wherein internal silanol defects are significantly reduced. At a water activity level of 0.95 (35 °C), the total water uptake by silicalite-1 (F−) was found to be 0.263 mmol/g, which was only 12.6\%, 9.8\%, and 3.3\% of the capacity for silicalite-1 (OH−), H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:140), and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:15), respectively, under the same conditions. While water adsorption shows distinct isotherms for different MFI-type zeolites due to the difference in the concentration, distribution, and types of hydrophilic sites, the ethanol adsorption isotherms present relatively comparable results because of the overall organophilic nature of the zeolite framework. Due to the dramatic differences in the sorption behavior with the different sorbate−sorbent pairs, different models are applied to correlate and analyze the sorption isotherms. An adsorption potential theory was used to fit the water adsorption isotherms on all MFI-type zeolite adsorbents studied. The Langmuir model and Sircar’s model are applied to describe ethanol adsorption on silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 samples, respectively. An ideal ethanol/water adsorption selectivity (α) was estimated for the fluoride-mediated silicalite-1. At 35 °C, α was estimated to be 36 for a 5 mol \% ethanol solution in water increasing to 53 at an ethanol concentration of 1 mol \%. The adsorption data demonstrate that silicalite-1 made via the fluoride-mediated route is a promising candidate for ethanol extraction from dilute ethanol−water solutions.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic ethanol/water separation capability of ZIF-8 is characterized by a detailed study of adsorption and diffusion of ethanol and water vapor in dodecahedral crystals with principle axis dimension of 324, 15.8, and 0.4 μm. ZIF-8 exhibits extremely low water uptakes. At 35 °C and a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.95, the water uptakes for 324, 15.8, and 0.4 μm ZIF-8 are 0.184, 0.197, and 0.503 mmol/g, respectively, all of which are less than 1 wt \% increase relative to original sorbent mass (0.33, 0.35, 0.91 wt \%). For ethanol adsorption, ZIF-8 exhibits an S-shape isotherm with low ethanol uptakes at P/Po up to 0.08 and the cage filling phenomenon occurs at P/Po higher than 0.08. The ethanol saturation uptake in ZIF-8 is as high as 30\% of the sorbent weight. Because of the existence of the hydrophilic −N−H functionality introduced by the terminating imidazolate (Im) linker and the overall hydrophobicity of the inner network, the effect of outer surface area of ZIF-8 crystals is proved to be non-negligible as ZIF-8 crystals becomes smaller despite the extremely large inner surface area and pore volume, especially for water sorption. The variation of isosteric heats of adsorption for water reveals the existence of structural defect of ZIF-8 framework. Transport diffusivity and corrected diffusivity for water and ethanol in ZIF-8 are determined within the entire P/Po range. The ethanol/water separation performance in ZIF-8 is evaluated in terms of vaporphase sorption selectivity and permselectivity. While ZIF-8 exhibits ample ethanol/water sorption selectivity, it is not effective for ethanol extraction as a membrane material from dilute ethanol aqueous solutions due to the unfavorable diffusion selectivity and the competitive water uptakes in the adsorbed ethanol phase.},

  abstract = {The wettability of a polymer surface�related to its hydrophobicity or tendency to repel water�can be crucial for determining its utility, such as for a coating or a purification membrane. While wettability is commonly associated with the macroscopic measurement of a contact angle between surface, water, and air, the molecular physics that underlie these macroscopic observations are not fully known, and anticipating the relative behavior of different polymers is challenging. To address this gap in molecular-level understanding, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate and contrast interactions of water with six chemically distinct polymers: polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, poly(methyl methacrylate), Nylon-66, and poly(vinyl alcohol). We show that several prospective quantitative metrics for hydrophobicity agree well with experimental contact angles. Moreover, the behavior of water in proximity to these polymer surfaces can be distinguished with analysis of interfacial water dynamics, extent of hydrogen bonding, and molecular orientation�even when macroscopic measures of hydrophobicity are similar. The predominant factor dictating wettability is found to be the extent of hydrogen bonding between polymer and water, but the precise manifestation of hydrogen bonding and its impact on surface water structure varies. In the absence of hydrogen bonding, other molecular interactions and polymer mechanics control hydrophobic ordering. These results provide new insights into how polymer chemistry specifically impacts water−polymer interactions and translates to surface hydrophobicity. Such factors may facilitate the design or processing of polymer surfaces to achieve targeted wetting behavior, and presented analyses can be useful in studying the interfacial physics of other systems.},

  abstract = {We introduce an indirect approach to estimate the solvation contributions to the thermodynamics of noncovalent complex formation through molecular dynamics simulation. This estimation is demonstrated by potential of mean force and entropy calculations on the binding process between β-cyclodextrin (host) and four drug molecules puerarin, daidzin, daidzein, and nabumetone (guest) in explicit water, followed by a stepwise extraction of individual enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) terms from the total free energy. Detailed analysis on the energetics of the host−guest complexation demonstrates that flexibility of the binding partners and solvation-related ΔH and ΔS need to be included explicitly for accurate estimation of the binding thermodynamics. From this, and our previous work on the solvent dependency of binding energies (Zhang et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 12684−12693), it follows that calculations neglecting host or guest flexibility, or those employing implicit solvent, will not be able to systematically predict binding free energies. The approach presented here can be readily adopted for obtaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing noncovalent associations in solution.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to study ethanol−water mixtures and the corresponding pure species, confined within slit-shaped graphene nanopores. Extensive structural and dynamical properties of the confined fluids, including hydrogen-bonding behavior, were investigated. The effects of pore width and mixture composition on the confined behavior were illustrated. It is observed that a layered structure is formed within the confined spaces and the ethanol− water mixtures show segregation at larger pores, with ethanol molecules preferentially adsorbing on graphene surfaces. This microphase demixing behavior stems from the competitive effect of the solid−fluid and fluid−fluid interactions. Moreover, miscellaneous diffusion mechanisms have been revealed for the hydrogen-bonding mixtures within the graphene pores. In the mixtures, water and ethanol generally display analogous diffusion mechanism due to ethanol−water association, converting from short-time subdiffusion to long-time Fickian diffusion in the larger nanopores. In the smaller pore (7 Å), both ethanol and water show a suppressed single-file diffusion behavior at the initial time and then display subdiffusion or single-file diffusion behavior. The complex diffusion behavior of ethanol−water mixtures can be described by the collaborating effects of pore confinement and enhanced interaction in the hydrogen-bonding mixtures.},
