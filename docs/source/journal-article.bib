  abstract = {We have investigated the structure of tert-butanol-toluene liquid mixtures when confined in the cylindrical channels of MCM-41 mesoporous silicate, and we can conclude on the existence of a microphase-separated tubular structure of these binary liquids although fully miscible in bulk conditions. Neutron diffraction experiments with selective isotopic compositions have been performed to vary systematically the scattering length density and thus to highlight different mixture components. The observed apparently anomalous variation of the intensity of the Bragg peaks of the MCM-41 after filling demonstrates without further analysis that the liquid mixture must be inhomogeneous at the nanoscale. Our experimental observations can be rationalized when comparing with the predictions of simple core-shell models. Within this core- shell model, we deduce that tert-butanol segregates as a pore surface layer of about one atomic size surrounding a toluene-rich core of two to three atomic layers.},

  abstract = {We carry out molecular dynamics of peeling of a graphene nanosheet from a flat substrate, for the case in which the system is completely immersed in water. Entrance effects are shown to dominate the dynamics of the peeling front.           ,              Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water. Peeling is induced by lifting one of the nanosheet edges with an assigned pulling velocity normal to the flat substrate. Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance. Surprisingly, the shape of the sheet was found to be approximately independent of the pulling velocity even for the largest velocities considered.},

Here we report a microscopic scenario for the molecular mechanism responsible for hysteresis in sorption-induced swelling in natural polymers such as cellulose using atom-scale simulation; moisture content and swelling exhibit hysteresis upon ad- and desorption but not swelling versus moisture content. Different hydrogen bond networks are examined; cellulose swells to form water\textendash cellulose bonds upon adsorption but these bonds do not break upon desorption at the same chemical potential. These findings, which are supported by mechanical testing and cellulose textural assessment upon sorption, shed light on experimental observations for wood and other related materials.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation of quadrupolar nuclei is governed by the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations at their position. In classical molecular dynamics (MD), the electron cloud contribution to the EFG can be included via the Sternheimer approximation, in which the full EFG at the nucleus that can be computed using quantum density functional theory (DFT) is considered to be proportional to that arising from the external, classical charge distribution. In this work, we systematically assess the quality of the Sternheimer approximation as well as the impact of the classical force field (FF) on the NMR relaxation rates of aqueous quadrupolar ions at infinite dilution. In particular, we compare the rates obtained using an ab initio parametrized polarizable FF, a recently developed empirical FF with scaled ionic charges and a simple empirical nonpolarizable FF with formal ionic charges. Surprisingly, all three FFs considered yield good values for the rates of smaller and less polarizable solutes (Li+, Na+, K+, Cl-), provided that a model-specific Sternheimer parametrization is employed. Yet, the polarizable and scaled charge FFs yield better estimates for divalent and more polarizable species (Mg2+, Ca2+, Cs+). We find that a linear relationship between the quantum and classical EFGs holds well in all of the cases considered; however, such an approximation often leads to quite large errors in the resulting EFG variance, which is directly proportional to the computed rate. We attempted to reduce the errors by including first order nonlinear corrections to the EFG, yet no clear improvement for the resulting variance has been found. The latter result indicates that more refined methods for determining the EFG at the ion position, in particular those that take into account the instantaneous atomic environment around an ion, might be necessary to systematically improve the NMR relaxation rate estimates in classical MD.},

Yet, obtaining links to molecular motion is challenging for many ions that relax through the quadrupolar mechanism, which is mediated by electric field gradient fluctuations and lacks a detailed microscopic description. For sodium ions in aqueous electrolytes, we combine ab initio calculations to account for electron cloud effects with classical molecular dynamics to sample long-time fluctuations, and obtain relaxation rates in good agreement with experiments over broad concentration and temperature ranges. We demonstrate that quadrupolar nuclear relaxation is sensitive to subpicosecond dynamics not captured by previous models based on water reorientation or cluster rotation. While ions affect the overall water retardation, experimental trends are mainly explained by dynamics in the first two solvation shells of sodium, which contain mostly water. This work thus paves the way to the quantitative understanding of quadrupolar relaxation in electrolyte and bioelectrolyte systems.},

Ethanol is found to be in the               gauche               conformation, while the monomer distances and orientations likely reflect a cooperation between the strong (O\textendash H{$\cdots$}O) and weak (C\textendash H{$\cdots$}O) hydrogen bonds that stabilizes the measured conformer. No other conformers were assigned in an argon expansion, confirming that this is the ground-state structure. This result is consistent with previous vibrationally-resolved Raman and infrared work, but sheds additional light on the structure, due to the specificity of rotational spectroscopy.},

The TIP4P parameters are used as a starting point. The key step, to determine simultaneously both properties, is to perform simulations at 240 K where a molecular dipole moment of minimum density is found. The minimum is shifted to larger values of {$\mu$} as the distance between the oxygen atom and site M, lOM, decreases. First, the parameters that define the dipole moment are adjusted to reproduce the experimental dielectric constant and then the Lennard-Jones parameters are varied to match the temperature of maximum density. The minimum on density at 240 K allows understanding why reported TIP4P models fail to reproduce the temperature of maximum density, the dielectric constant, or both properties. The new model reproduces some of the thermodynamic and transport anomalies of water. Additionally, the dielectric constant, thermodynamics, and dynamical and structural properties at different temperatures and pressures are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The computational cost of the new model is the same as that of the TIP4P.},

In each mixture, for ethanol the OPLS force field was used, combined with three different water force fields, the SPC/E, the TIP4P-2005, and the SWM4-DP. Water potential models were distinguished on the basis of deviations between calculated and measured total scattering X-ray structure factors aided by ethanol-water pair binding energy comparison. No single water force field could provide the best agreement with experimental data at all concentrations: at the ethanol content of 80\% the SWM-DP, for 60 mol \% the SWM4-DP and the TIP4P-2005, whereas for the 40 and 20 mol \% mixtures TIP4P-2005 water force field provided the closest match. Coordination numbers and hydrogen bonds/molecule values were calculated, revealing that the oxygen-oxygen first coordination numbers strongly overestimate the average number of hydrogen bonds/molecule. The center-of-molecule distributions indicate that the ethanol-ethanol first coordination sphere expands with increasing water concentration while the size of the first water-water coordination sphere does not change. Various two and three-dimensional distributions were calculated that reveal the differences between simulations with different water force fields.

  abstract = {Since the structural transformations observed in water-ethanol binary mixtures are apparently driven by relatively weak intermolecular forces (like hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding) that often cooperate to form self-assembled structures, one expects the aggregation properties to show strong temperature dependence. We study the effect of temperature on the formation of transient ethanol clusters as well as on the dynamic density heterogeneity induced in the system due to such clustering. The dynamic heterogeneity is expected to occur on small length scales with short lifetime \textendash{} both are expected to be temperature dependent. Indeed, a major finding of the work is strong temperature dependence of the extent of structural heterogeneity. Distinct signature of static and dynamic heterogeneity of ethanol molecules is also found to appear with lowering of temperature. This is attributed to the formation of transient ethanol clusters that are known to exhibit considerably small lifetime (order of a few picosecond). The transient dynamical features of dynamic heterogeneity are expected to affect those relaxation processes occurring at subpicosecond time scales. On the other hand, strong temperature dependence of micro-structure formation can be anticipated to be due to enhanced structural order stimulated in the system with lowering of temperature. Present analyses reveal a number of interesting features which were not explored beforehand in this widely studied binary mixture.},

Here, we perform simulations of particles reversibly adsorbing at the surface of a nanopore and show that the fluctuations in the number of adsorbed particles exhibit low-frequency pink noise. We furthermore propose theoretical modeling for the timedependent adsorption of particles on the nanopore surface for various geometries, which predicts a frequency spectrum in very good agreement with the simulation results. Altogether, our results highlight that the low-frequency noise takes its origin in the reversible adsorption of ions at the pore surface combined with the long-lasting excursions of the ions in the reservoirs. The scaling regime of the power spectrum extends down to a cutoff frequency which is far smaller than simple diffusion estimates. Using realistic values for the pore dimensions and the adsorption-desorption kinetics, this predicts the observation of pink noise for frequencies down to the hertz for a typical solid-state nanopore, in good agreement with experiments.},

  abstract = {Significance             Aquaporin channels are able to selectively conduct water across cell membranes, with remarkable efficiency. Although molecular details are crucial to the pore performance, permeability is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation at the entrances. Could the hourglass shape of aquaporins optimize such entrance effects? We show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the channel permeability. Strikingly, the optimal opening angles compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins, suggesting that their hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. This work also provides guidelines to optimize the performances of artificial nanopores, with applications in desalination, ultrafiltration, or energy conversion.           ,              The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that maximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of aquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal hydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results provide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.},

The resulting density profiles illustrate that demixing of solvents occurs at the pore wall region, which is composed of silanol molecules in our case. Ethanol molecules are more likely to attach to the wall via hydrogen bonds than water molecules. A noticeable O-H bond orientation is observed for the ethanol molecules in this region, which can be explained by the formation of two specific hydrogen bonds between ethanol and silanol. Water, in contrast, resides mostly outside the interfacial region and is in favor of forming small hydrogen bonded strings and clusters with other water molecules. This phenomenon is corroborated by both the orientation of ethanol hydroxyl groups and the radial distribution functions of the solvent oxygen atom to the silanol hydrogen atom. Ethanol selectively attaches to the wall and forms a layer close to the wall. The hydrophobic headgroups of these ethanol molecules lead to an internal hydrophobic interface layer, which in turn yields cluster structures in the adjacent water. The self-diffusion of water in the confined ethanol-water mixture at the center of the pore is faster than that of water in the bulk ethanol-water mixture; ethanol, on the other hand, diffuses slower when it is confined.},

  abstract = {Aqueous binary mixtures have received immense attention in recent years because of their extensive application in several biological and industrial processes. The water-ethanol binary mixture serves as a unique system because it exhibits composition-dependent alteration of dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our present work demonstrates how different compositions of water-ethanol binary mixtures affect the pair hydrophobicity of different hydrophobes. Pair hydrophobicity is measured by the depth of the first minimum (contact minima) of potential of mean force (PMF) profile between two hydrophobes. The pair hydrophobicity is found to be increased with addition of ethanol to water up to a mole fraction of xEtOH = 0.10 and decreased with further addition of ethanol. This observation is shown to be true for three (methane-methane, isobutane-isobutane, and toluene-toluene) different pairs of hydrophobes. Decomposition of PMF into enthalpic and entropic contribution indicates a switch from entropic to enthalpic stabilization of the contact minimum upon addition of ethanol to water. The gain in mixing enthalpy of the binary solvent system upon association of two hydrophobes is found to be the determining factor for the stabilization of contact minimum. Several static/ dynamics quantities (average composition fluctuations, diffusion coefficients, fluctuations in total dipole moment, propensity of ethyl-ethyl association, etc) of the ethanol-water binary mixture also show irregularities around xEtOH = 0.10-0.15. We have also discovered that the hydrogen bonding pattern of ethanol rather than water reveals a change in trend near the similar composition range. As the anomalous behavior of the physical/dynamical properties along with the pair hydrophobicity in an aqueous binary mixture of amphiphilic solutes is a common phenomenon, our results may provide a general viewpoint on these aspects.},

However, despite its widespread use, key questions regarding the thickness and composition of molecules at the ethanol/water/air surface remain unclear. Recent thermodynamic analyses, Bagheri and co-authors (2016) and Santos and Reis (2018), indicated that the interfacial thickness is not constant. However, the interfacial thickness from these two analyses follows opposite trends. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the thickness and composition of the interfacial layer by combining neutron reflectivity (NR) experiments with rigorous molecular simulation. The interfacial composition was determined from molecular simulations and, in conjunction with the Gibbs excess concentration, used to calculate the interfacial thickness. It was found that the thickness decreased exponentially and reached a plateau of \textasciitilde{} 8.2 \AA. The results confirm the trends obtained thermodynamically from surface tension. The study also provides a new theoretical framework to describe the interfacial layer of water/alcohol mixtures.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

In a previous article [Kashefolgheta               et al.               ,               J. Chem. Theory.

For a set of               N               molecules that are all in the liquid state under ambient conditions, such a matrix encompasses               N               \texttimes{}               N               entries for                              considering each of the               N               molecules either as solute (A) or as solvent (B). In the quoted study, a cross-solvation matrix of 25 \texttimes{} 25 experimental                              value was introduced, considering 25 small molecules representative for alkanes, chloroalkanes, ethers, ketones, esters, alcohols, amines, and amides. This experimental data was used to compare the relative accuracies of four popular condensed-phase force fields, namely GROMOS-2016H66, OPLS-AA, AMBER-GAFF, and CHARMM-CGenFF. In the present work, the comparison is extended to five additional force fields, namely GROMOS-54A7, GROMOS-ATB, OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, and OpenFF. Considering these nine force fields, the correlation coefficients between experimental values and simulation results range from 0.76 to 0.88, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.9 to 4.8 kJ mol               -1               , and average errors (AVEEs) from -1.5 to +1.0 kJ mol               -1               . In terms of RMSEs, GROMOS-2016H66 and OPLS-AA present the best accuracy (2.9 kJ mol               -1               ), followed by OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, AMBER-GAFF, and OpenFF (3.3 to 3.6 kJ mol               -1               ), and then by GROMOS-54A7, CHARM-CGenFF, and GROMOS-ATB (4.0 to 4.8 kJ mol               -1               ). These differences are statistically significant but not very pronounced, and are distributed rather heterogeneously over the set of compounds within the different force fields.},

Experimental characterization of both propene and propane diffusivity in ZIF-8 has been provided. Using               2               H NMR spin relaxation analysis, the motional mechanisms for propene and propane guests trapped within the ZIF-8 framework have been elucidated. Kinetic parameters for each type of motion were derived.

For nitroalkanes, the calculated gauche (g) conformer of the C-C-C-N torsion is more stable than trans (t). Consequently, nitropropane MD simulations with C27rn result in 74\% population of this g conformer. The C27rn FF is in excellent agreement with experiment for various bulk (density, isothermal compressibility, and heat of vaporization) and interfacial (surface tension) properties of nitropropane, nitrobutane, and nitrobenzene.

  abstract = {The industries discharge a variety of pollutants, such as heavy metals, organic toxins, and oils, in water resources. Exposure of these contaminants in water causes adverse health effects on various forms of life. Novel materials are needed for the effective removal of pollutants from industrial wastewater. Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets are promising materials for removal of organic pollutants. In this work, the suitability of the sheets for the separation of the ethanol-water mixture is investigated by studying the adsorption and structural behavior of ethanol-water mixtures in slit pores with variable width (7-13 \AA ) using molecular dynamics simulations. The selectivity of ethanol is found to depend on the pore-width and nature of the pore walls. The selectivity of ethanol is highest for 9 \AA{} pores and lowest for 7 \AA{} pores, irrespective of the nature of the pore walls. However, selectivity of ethanol is relatively higher for hBN pores compared to the graphene pores, for all the considered pore widths. At a lower pore width, molecular sieving plays an important role for selective adsorption of ethanol molecules. On the other hand, at a higher pore width, selective adsorption of ethanol molecules is affected by the nature of the pore walls. The diffusion coefficients of water and ethanol molecules substantially decrease with a decrease in pore width for both graphene and hBN surfaces. The resident time of water and ethanol molecules decreases with increase in the slit-width. Furthermore, water and ethanol molecules confined in hBN pores show higher residence time and lower diffusion coefficient values compared to graphene pores. The adsorption behavior of water and ethanol molecules in the slit pores are analyzed using the potential mean forces, for water and ethanol molecules on the graphene and hBN surfaces, which are determined by umbrella sampling technique.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a structurally simple and nontoxic water-soluble polymer that is widely used in medical and pharmaceutical applications as molecular linker and spacer. In such applications, PEG's elastic response against conformational deformations is key to its function. According to text-book knowledge, a polymer reacts to the stretching of its end-to-end separation by a decrease in entropy that is due to the reduction of available conformations, which is why polymers are commonly called entropic springs. By a combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments with molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, we show that entropic hydration effects almost exactly compensate the chain conformational entropy loss at high stretching. Our simulations reveal that this entropic compensation is due to the stretching-induced release of water molecules that in the relaxed state form double hydrogen bonds with PEG. As a consequence, the stretching response of PEG is predominantly of energetic, not of entropic, origin at high forces and caused by hydration effects, while PEG backbone deformations only play a minor role. These findings demonstrate the importance of hydration for the mechanics of macromolecules and constitute a case example that sheds light on the antagonistic interplay of conformational and hydration degrees of freedom.},

This tendency can be amplified by geometrical nanoconfinement, leading to remarkable properties. This work investigates the molecular dynamics of tert-butanol (TBA)-toluene (TOL) mixtures confined in silica nanochannels by quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulation. It reveals a decoupling of the molecular motion of each constituent of the binary liquid, which can be followed independently by selective isotopic H/D labeling. We argue that this behavior is the signature of spatially segregated dynamic heterogeneities, which are due to the recently established core-shell nanophase separation induced by mesoporous confinement.},

  abstract = {New ultrasonic and hypersonic measurements of the speed of sound in aqueous ethanol mixtures are presented, particularly in the temperature and ethanol-concentration domains of the maximum of sound. Molecular Dynamics studies indicate that these mixtures show aggregation of ethanol molecules in the low ethanol mole fraction x b 0.2, bicontinuous-like phase around x = 0.5, and weak water clustering above x = 0.8. The resulting micro-heterogeneity is seen to affect the long range part of all the correlation functions of the aggregating species. Nevertheless, simulation results help understanding the general trends seen in the experimental results: it is the structural change between ethanol's clustering and water-ethanol microsegregation that corresponds to the maximum observed in the speed of sound around x = 0.15.},

  abstract = {We observe, by computer simulations, a remarkable long-distance, rare, but repetitive, exchange of ethanol molecules between two parallel graphene surfaces in nanoconfined, aqueous, ethanol solutions. We compute the rate of exchange as a function of the separation (d) between the two surfaces. We discover that the initiating (or, the launching) step in this exchange is the attainment of an instantaneous orientation of the carbon\textendash oxygen bond vector relative to the graphene surface. This observation led us to construct a two-dimensional free energy surface for this exchange, with respect to two order parameters, namely, (i) the perpendicular distance of ethanol molecule from the graphene surfaces, z, and (ii) the orientation of the O\textendash C bond vector, \texttheta, of the tagged ethanol molecule. For d = 3~nm, the rate of exchange is found to be 0.44~ns               -1               for the force field used. We also vary the force field and determine the sensitivity of the rate. From the free energy landscape, one could determine the minimum energy pathway. We use both, the transition state theory and Kramers' theory, to calculate the rate. The calculated rate agrees well with the simulated value as mentioned above. We find that the rate of exchange phenomenon is sensitive to the interaction strength of graphene and the hydrophobic group of ethanol. The free energy landscape exchange shows dependence on the distance separation of the two hydrophobic surfaces and reveals interesting features.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented to identify the truly interfacial molecules at fluid/fluid interfaces seen at molecular resolution, a situation that regularly occurs in computer simulations. In the new method, the surface is scanned by moving a probe sphere of a given radius along a large set of test lines that are perpendicular to the plane of the interface. The molecules that are hit by the probe spheres are regarded as interfacial ones, and the position of the test spheres when they are in contact with the interfacial molecules give an estimate of the surface. The dependence of the method on various parameters, in particular, on the size of the probe sphere is discussed in detail. Based on the list of molecules identified as truly interfacial ones, two measures of the molecular scale roughness of the surface are proposed. The bivariate distribution of the lateral and normal distances of two points of the interface provides a full description of the molecular scale morphology of the surface in a statistical sense. For practical purposes two parameters related to the dependence of the average normal distance of two surface points on their lateral distance can be used. These two parameters correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the surface roughness, respectively. The new method is applied for the analysis of the molecular level structure of the liquid\textendash vapor interface of water. As an immediate result of the application of the new method it is shown that the orientational preferences of the interfacial water molecules depend only on the local curvature of the interface, and hence the molecules located at wells of concave curvature of the rippled surface prefer the same orientations as waters located at the surface of small apolar solutes. The vast majority of the truly interfacial molecules are found to form a strongly percolating two-dimensional hydrogen bonded network at the surface, whereas no percolation is observed within the second molecular layer beyond the surface.},

When mixed in small concentrations with water or alkanes, it forms aggregate structures reminiscent of, respectively, the direct and inverse micellar aggregates found in emulsions, albeit at much smaller sizes. At higher concentrations, micro-heterogeneous mixing with segregated domains is found. We examine how different statistical methods, namely correlation function analysis, structure factor analysis and cluster distribution analysis, can describe efficiently these morphological changes in these mixtures. In particular, we explain how the neat alcohol pre-peak of the structure factor evolves into the domain pre-peak under mixing conditions, and how this evolution differs whether the co-solvent is water or alkane. This study clearly establishes the heuristic superiority of the correlation function/structure factor analysis to study the micro-heterogeneity, since cluster distribution analysis is insensitive to domain segregation. Correlation functions detect the domains, with a clear structure factor pre-peak signature, while the cluster techniques detect the cluster hierarchy within domains. The main conclusion is that, in micro-segregated mixtures, the domain structure is a more fundamental statistical entity than the underlying cluster structures. These findings could help better understand comparatively the radiation scattering experiments, which are sensitive to domains,               versus               the spectroscopy-NMR experiments, which are sensitive to clusters.},

J. 2011, 40, 843-856] and involves a recalibration of the nonbonded interaction parameters for the charged amino acid side chains, based on ionic side chain analogs. After a thorough analysis of the available experimental data, conventional hydration free energies for the ammonium; mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; formate; acetate; propanoate; imidazolium; and guanidinium ions are combined with a standard absolute intrinsic proton hydration free energy {$\Delta$}Gh{$\ominus$}yd[Hg+] = -1100 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1 to yield absolute intrinsic single-ion hydration free energies serving as experimental target data. The raw hydration free energies calculated from atomistic simulations are affected by electrostatic and finite-size artifacts, and corrections are applied to reach methodological independence prior to comparison with these experimental values. Except for monomethyl-ammonium, ions with parameters derived directly from the 54A7 force field considerably underestimate (ammonium, formate, acetate, propanoate, guanidinium) or overestimate (di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; imidazolium) the magnitude of the intrinsic hydration free energy, the largest deviation affecting the acetate ion (40.0 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1). After reparameterization into 54A8, the mean and maximal absolute deviations between simulated and experimental data over the set of 10 ions are reduced from 23.1 and 40.0 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1, respectively, to 1.8 and 6.3 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1, respectively. Although the 54A7 and 54A8 parameter sets differ significantly in terms of the hydration free energies of the ions considered, other properties such as ion-water radial distribution functions and ion-ion potentials of mean force appear to be only moderately sensitive to this change. These properties are similar for the two sets and, in the case of the ion-water radial distribution functions, in good agreement with available experimental data.},

An initial stochastic search provided around 2\,500\,000 candidate structures, then, using a convex-hull polygon criterion followed by gradient based optimization under the Kohn\textendash Sham scheme, a total of 54 well defined local minima were located in the Potential Energy Surface. These structures were further analyzed through second-order many-body perturbation theory with an extended basis set at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. Our analysis of Gibbs energies at several temperatures clearly suggests a structural preference toward compact water clusters interacting with the external methane molecule, instead of the more commonly known clathrate-like structures. This study shows that CH               4               \textendash (H               2               O)               12               clusters may be detected at temperatures up to 179 K, this finding provides strong support to a recently postulated hypothesis that suggests that methane\textendash water clusters could be present in Mars at these conditions. Interestingly, we found that water to water hydrogen bonding is strengthened in the mixed clusters when compared to the isolated water dimer, which in turn leads to a weakening of the methane to water hydrogen bonding when compared to the CH               4               \textendash (H               2               O) dimer.

The dominating low-frequency Cole\textendash Cole (CC) dispersion ( j=1) is assigned to the cooperative dynamics of the H-bond system where the motions of alcohol and water molecules cannot be distinguished. Its time scale is largely governed by the number density of H-bond acceptor and donor sites but steric effects also contribute. Two additional Debye (D) terms ( j=2 and j=3) with relaxation times of s2\textasciitilde 10\textendash 20 ps and s3\textasciitilde 1\textendash 2 ps are required to reproduce the high-frequency part of the spectrum. These small-amplitude dispersion steps can be assigned to the motion of singly H-bonded alcohol monomers at the ends of the chain structure ( j=2) and to the flipping motion of free OH ( j=3). The increase of the amplitude De2 and the simultaneous decrease of the (effective) dipole\textendash dipole correlation factor with decreasing XA in \textasciitilde 0.5VXAV1.0 suggests insertion of water molecules into the zigzag structure of H-bonded alcohol chains inducing a reduction of the average chain length and an increase of the number of end-standing alcohol molecules that can contribute to the s2-mode.},

The MD simulations of the 1H NMR relaxation times T1;2 in the fast motion regime where T1 {$\frac{1}{4}$} T2 agree with measured (de-oxygenated) T2 data at ambient conditions, without any adjustable parameters in the interpretation of the simulation data. Likewise, the translational diffusion DT coefficients calculated using simulation configurations agree with measured diffusion data at ambient conditions. The agreement between the predicted and experimentally measured NMR relaxation times and diffusion coefficient also validate the forcefields used in the simulation. The molecular simulations naturally separate intramolecular from intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions helping bring new insight into the two NMR relaxation mechanisms as a function of molecular chain-length (i.e. carbon number). Comparison of the MD simulation results of the two relaxation mechanisms with traditional hard-sphere models used in interpreting NMR data reveals important limitations in the latter. With increasing chain length, there is substantial deviation in the molecular size inferred on the basis of the radius of gyration from simulation and the fitted hard-sphere radii required to rationalize the relaxation times. This deviation is characteristic of the local nature of the NMR measurement, one that is well-captured by molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics studies have demonstrated that molecular water at an interface, with either a gas or a solid, displays anisotropic orientational behavior in contrast to its bulk counterpart. This effect has been recently implicated in the like-charge attraction problem for colloidal particles in solution. Here, negatively charged particles in solution display a long-ranged attraction where continuum electrostatic theory predicts monotonically repulsive interactions, particularly in solutions with monovalent salt ions at low ionic strength. Anisotropic orientational behavior of solvent molecules at an interface gives rise to an excess interfacial electrical potential which we suggest generates an additional solvation contribution to the total free energy that is traditionally overlooked in continuum descriptions of interparticle interactions in solution. In the present investigation we perform molecular dynamics simulation based calculations of the interfacial potential using realistic surface models representing various chemistries as well as different solvents. Similar to previous work that focused on simple model surfaces constructed by using oxygen atoms, we find that solvents at more realistic model surfaces exhibit substantial anisotropic orientational behavior. We explore the dependence of the interfacial solvation potential on surface properties such as surface group chemistry and group density at silica and carboxylated polystyrene interfaces. For water, we note surprisingly good agreement between results obtained for a simple O-atom wall and more complex surface models, suggesting a general qualitative consistency of the interfacial solvation effect for surfaces in contact with water. In contrast, for an aprotic solvent such as DMSO, surface chemistry appears to exert a stronger influence on the sign and magnitude of the interfacial solvation potential. The study carries broad implications for molecular-scale interactions and may find relevance in explaining a range of phenomena in softmatter physics and cell biology.},

  abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks are promising nanoporous materials for adsorption heat pumps (AHPs) using water and alcohols as working fluids due to their ultrahigh surface area. The heat transfer in porous crystals containing adsorbed gases is vital for their performance in adsorbed natural gas storage or AHPs. However, limited attention has been paid to their thermal properties. In this study, equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the impacts of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). The results demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 increased from 0.165 to 0.319 W m-1 K-1 with the increased number of adsorbed ethanol molecules. On the contrary, the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 upon water adsorption is approximately 0.190 W m-1 K-1, which is not significantly affected by the number of adsorbed water molecules. Such a different tendency may be ascribed to the different interaction strengths between ZIF-8 and gas molecules. In addition, the larger overlap energy in the vibrational density of state of ZIF-8/ethanol than that of ZIF-8/ water also correlates with the higher thermal conductivity of the ZIF-8/ethanol system. This work provides molecular insights into the effects of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8, which may inspire further exploration of novel techniques to improve the heat transfer performance of practical applications.},

Pressure\textendash hydration curves obtained               via               sorption experiments reveal that the repulsion significantly increases when the membranes are loaded with co-solutes, most strongly for TMAO. As a result, the co-solutes retain additional water molecules and therefore provide membranes with a fluid and more physiological environment. The experimental data are quantitatively reproduced in complementary solvent-explicit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, which yield the chemical potential of water. Simulation analysis reveals that the additional repulsion arises from the osmotic pressure generated by the co-solutes, an effect which is maximal for TMAO, due to its unfavorable interactions with the lipid headgroup layer and its extraordinarily high osmotic coefficient.},

The negative {$\zeta$}-potential of zwitterionic net-neutral phospholipid vesicles in neat water, which changes sign and increases in solutions of NaCl or KCl, is a phenomenon consistently observed in experiments but not fully understood theoretically. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of applied electric fields which drive electroosmotic flows, in combination with an electrostatic continuum model based on the modified Poisson-Boltzmann and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equations, we study the electrokinetic and electrostatic properties as well as the specific ion affinities to the phospholipid-water interface, in order to resolve these puzzling observations. Our modified continuum equations account for the dielectric profile at the lipid-water interface, ion-specific interactions between ions and the lipid-water interface, and the interfacial viscosity profile, which are all extracted from our atomistic simulations and rather accurately predict ion-density and electrostatic-potential distributions as well as {$\zeta$}-potentials in comparison with our atomistic simulations. Our continuum model can explain experimental {$\zeta$}-potentials only when we assume minute amounts of surface-active anionic impurities in the aqueous solution. In fact, the amount of impurities needed to explain the experimental data increases linearly with the salt concentration, suggesting that surface-active species, which might be already present in the lab water or lipid samples, could further be introduced through the added salt.},

We report direct enthalpy of adsorption ({$\Delta$}hads) measurements for ethanol and water vapor on porous silica glass (CPG-10), in both hydroxylated and dehydroxylated (hydrophobic) forms. The results suggest a spectrum of energetics as a function of coverage, stepwise for ethanol but continuous for water. The zero-coverage enthalpy of adsorption for hydroxylated silica shows the most exothermic enthalpies for both water (-72.7 {$\pm$} 3.1 kJ/mol water) and ethanol (-78.0 {$\pm$} 1.9 kJ/mol ethanol). The water adsorption enthalpy becomes less exothermic gradually until reaching its only plateau (-20.7 {$\pm$} 2.2 kJ/mol water) reflecting water clustering on a largely hydrophobic surface, while the enthalpy of ethanol adsorption profile presents two well separated plateaus, corresponding to strong chemisorption of ethanol on adsorbate-free silica surface (-66.4 {$\pm$} 4.8 kJ/mol ethanol), and weak physisorption of ethanol on ethanol covered silica (-4.0 {$\pm$} 1.6 kJ/mol ethanol). On the other hand, dehydroxylation leads to missing water-silica interactions, whereas the number of ethanol binding sites is not impacted. The isotherms and partial molar properties of adsorption suggest that water may only bind strongly onto the silanols (which are a minor species on silica glass), whereas ethanol can interact strongly with both silanols and the hydrophobic areas of the silica surface.},

The parameters for the 2-methyl imidazole (MeIM) ring are adopted from the AMBER force field, while the van der Waals (VDW) parameters for organic linkers and metal centers were determined by rescaling the UFF parameters as               {$\epsilon$}               = 0.635               {$\epsilon$}               UFF               and               {$\sigma$}               = 1.0               {$\sigma$}               UFF               to fit the CH               4               adsorption isotherms obtained by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with the force field parameters to the experimental ones. The CH               4               adsorption isotherms on four different structures of ZIF-8 at 298 K obtained by GCMC simulations are compared with the experimental data. The results show that the simulated CH               4               adsorption isotherms on the ZIF-8 structure reported from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) are closest to the ones on the ZIF-8 structure from the report of Moggach               et al.               To test our model, adsorption isotherms of CH               4               , H               2               , CO               2               and N               2               at different temperatures were computed using GCMC simulations, and the results were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. In the case of H               2               , the equilibrium configurations obtained by GCMC simulations were statistically analyzed with ad hoc code to get probability density distribution profiles. These profiles were transformed to visual slice images, which indicate that the preferential adsorption sites of H               2               molecules in ZIF-8 are located close to the MeIM rings, where the host\textendash guest VDW or electrostatic interactions are maximal, as revealed by the potential energy surfaces (PES). In addition, these force field parameters were confirmed to well reproduce the ZIF-8 structural properties including lattice constants, bond lengths and angles over a wide range of temperatures. The self-diffusivities at the specific loadings of adsorbed gases (CH               4               , H               2               and CO               2               ) in ZIF-8 were calculated by the mean squared displacement (MSD) method. It was found that our self-diffusivities of H               2               are slightly higher than the ones in the literature, and our self-diffusivity of CO               2               is as about three times as the one in the literature, due to the different partial charges and the effect of different force field parameters on framework shape and flexibility in our simulations.},

These results indicate that the hydrophobic hydration in bulk induces the surface excess of the alcohols and after a monolayer is formed, the hydrophobic hydration itself is no longer retained.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic ethanol/water separation capability of ZIF-8 is characterized by a detailed study of adsorption and diffusion of ethanol and water vapor in dodecahedral crystals with principle axis dimension of 324, 15.8, and 0.4 {$\mu$}m. ZIF-8 exhibits extremely low water uptakes. At 35 \textdegree C and a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.95, the water uptakes for 324, 15.8, and 0.4 {$\mu$}m ZIF-8 are 0.184, 0.197, and 0.503 mmol/g, respectively, all of which are less than 1 wt \% increase relative to original sorbent mass (0.33, 0.35, 0.91 wt \%). For ethanol adsorption, ZIF-8 exhibits an S-shape isotherm with low ethanol uptakes at P/Po up to 0.08 and the cage filling phenomenon occurs at P/Po higher than 0.08. The ethanol saturation uptake in ZIF-8 is as high as 30\% of the sorbent weight. Because of the existence of the hydrophilic -N-H functionality introduced by the terminating imidazolate (Im) linker and the overall hydrophobicity of the inner network, the effect of outer surface area of ZIF-8 crystals is proved to be non-negligible as ZIF-8 crystals becomes smaller despite the extremely large inner surface area and pore volume, especially for water sorption. The variation of isosteric heats of adsorption for water reveals the existence of structural defect of ZIF-8 framework. Transport diffusivity and corrected diffusivity for water and ethanol in ZIF-8 are determined within the entire P/Po range. The ethanol/water separation performance in ZIF-8 is evaluated in terms of vaporphase sorption selectivity and permselectivity. While ZIF-8 exhibits ample ethanol/water sorption selectivity, it is not effective for ethanol extraction as a membrane material from dilute ethanol aqueous solutions due to the unfavorable diffusion selectivity and the competitive water uptakes in the adsorbed ethanol phase.},

  abstract = {The wettability of a polymer surface\dbend related to its hydrophobicity or tendency to repel water\dbend can be crucial for determining its utility, such as for a coating or a purification membrane. While wettability is commonly associated with the macroscopic measurement of a contact angle between surface, water, and air, the molecular physics that underlie these macroscopic observations are not fully known, and anticipating the relative behavior of different polymers is challenging. To address this gap in molecular-level understanding, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate and contrast interactions of water with six chemically distinct polymers: polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, poly(methyl methacrylate), Nylon-66, and poly(vinyl alcohol). We show that several prospective quantitative metrics for hydrophobicity agree well with experimental contact angles. Moreover, the behavior of water in proximity to these polymer surfaces can be distinguished with analysis of interfacial water dynamics, extent of hydrogen bonding, and molecular orientation\dbend even when macroscopic measures of hydrophobicity are similar. The predominant factor dictating wettability is found to be the extent of hydrogen bonding between polymer and water, but the precise manifestation of hydrogen bonding and its impact on surface water structure varies. In the absence of hydrogen bonding, other molecular interactions and polymer mechanics control hydrophobic ordering. These results provide new insights into how polymer chemistry specifically impacts water-polymer interactions and translates to surface hydrophobicity. Such factors may facilitate the design or processing of polymer surfaces to achieve targeted wetting behavior, and presented analyses can be useful in studying the interfacial physics of other systems.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to study ethanol-water mixtures and the corresponding pure species, confined within slit-shaped graphene nanopores. Extensive structural and dynamical properties of the confined fluids, including hydrogen-bonding behavior, were investigated. The effects of pore width and mixture composition on the confined behavior were illustrated. It is observed that a layered structure is formed within the confined spaces and the ethanol- water mixtures show segregation at larger pores, with ethanol molecules preferentially adsorbing on graphene surfaces. This microphase demixing behavior stems from the competitive effect of the solid-fluid and fluid-fluid interactions. Moreover, miscellaneous diffusion mechanisms have been revealed for the hydrogen-bonding mixtures within the graphene pores. In the mixtures, water and ethanol generally display analogous diffusion mechanism due to ethanol-water association, converting from short-time subdiffusion to long-time Fickian diffusion in the larger nanopores. In the smaller pore (7 \AA ), both ethanol and water show a suppressed single-file diffusion behavior at the initial time and then display subdiffusion or single-file diffusion behavior. The complex diffusion behavior of ethanol-water mixtures can be described by the collaborating effects of pore confinement and enhanced interaction in the hydrogen-bonding mixtures.},
