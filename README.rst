Dipolar Nuclear Magnetic Resonance from Molecular Dynamics (DNMRfromMD) simulations
is a Python toolkit designed for the computation of 
dipolar NMR relaxation times (:math:`T1`` and :math:`T2`) from molecular dynamics simulations.
Used in combination with |MDAnalysis|, it allows for the analysis of trajectory
files from any MDAnalysis-compatible simulation package, including
|LAMMPS| and |GROMACS|.

Details about installation, use, and some of the common pitfalls of NMR calculations
are given in the |documentation|. The documentation also contains a description of
the theory behind dipolar H-NMR calculations.

Notes and known issues
----------------------

- this code is still in development, please raise an issue here if you encounter a problem
- the code has mostly been tested with GROMACS and LAMMPS trajectory files, but should work with other molecular dynamics packages, as long as they are compatible with MDAnalysis
- the code is not adapted to triclinic box, convert your trajectory to orthorhombic prior to calculation
- for very large trajectory file, the code requires a lot of memory
- the code has mostly been tested in the case of 1H-NMR (i.e. spin 1/2)
- NMRforMD only works for dipolar interaction, not quadrupolar interaction
